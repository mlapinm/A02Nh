Configuring and Verifying Switch
Interfaces
This chapter covers the following exam topics:
1.0 Network Fundamentals
1.1 Explain the role and function of network components
1.1.b L2 and L3 switches
1.4 Describe switching concepts
So far in this part, you have learned the skills to navigate the command-line interface (CLI)
and use commands that configure and verify switch features. You learned about the primary
purpose of a switch—forwarding Ethernet frames—and learned how to see that process
in action by looking at the switch MAC address table. After learning about the switch data
plane in Chapter 5, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Switching,” you learned a few management
plane features in Chapter 6, “Configuring Basic Switch Management,” like how to configure
the switch to support Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH) by configuring IP address and login
security.
This chapter focuses on switch interfaces in two major sections. The first section shows how
you can configure and change the operation of switch interfaces: how to change the speed,
duplex, or even disable the interface. The second half then focuses on how to use show commands on a switch to verify switch interface status and how to interpret the output to find
some of the more common issues with switch interfaces.
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
Take the quiz (either here or use the PTP software) if you want to use the score to help you
decide how much time to spend on this chapter. The letter answers are listed at the bottom
of the page following the quiz. Appendix C, found both at the end of the book as well as on
the companion website, includes both the answers and explanations. You can also find both
answers and explanations in the PTP testing software.

Configuring Switch Interfaces
IOS uses the term interface to refer to physical ports used to forward data to and from other
devices. Each interface can be configured with several settings, each of which might differ
from interface to interface. IOS uses interface subcommands to configure these settings.
Each of these settings may be different from one interface to the next, so you would first
identify the specific interface, and then configure the specific setting.
This section begins with a discussion of three relatively basic per-interface settings: the port
speed, duplex, and a text description. Following that, the text takes a short look at a pair
of the most common interface subcommands: the shutdown and no shutdown commands,
which administratively disable and enable the interface, respectively. This section ends with
a discussion about autonegotiation concepts, which in turn dictates what settings a switch
chooses to use when using autonegotiation.
Configuring Speed, Duplex, and Description
Switch interfaces that support multiple speeds (10/100 and 10/100/1000 interfaces), by
default, will autonegotiate what speed to use. However, you can configure the speed and
duplex settings with the duplex {auto | full | half} and speed {auto | 10 | 100 | 1000} interface subcommands. Simple enough.
Most of the time, using autonegotiation makes good sense, so when you set the duplex
and speed manually using these commands, you typically have a good reason to do so. For
instance, maybe you want to set the speed to the fastest possible on links between switches
just to avoid the chance that autonegotiation chooses a slower speed.

The description text interface subcommand lets you add a text description to the interface.
For instance, if you have good reason to configure the speed and duplex on a port, maybe
add a description that says why you did. Example 7-1 shows how to configure duplex and
speed, as well as the description command, which is simply a text description that can be
configured by the administrator.

First, focus on the mechanics of moving around in configuration mode again by looking
closely at the command prompts. The various interface commands move the user from
global mode into interface configuration mode for a specific interface. For instance, the
example configures the duplex, speed, and description commands all just after the interface
FastEthernet 0/1 command, which means that all three of those configuration settings apply
to interface Fa0/1, and not to the other interfaces.
The show interfaces status command lists much of the detail configured in Example 7-1,
even with only one line of output per interface. Example 7-2 shows an example, just after the
configuration in Example 7-1 was added to the switch.

Working through the output in the example:
FastEthernet 0/1 (Fa0/1): This output lists the first few characters of the configured
description. It also lists the configured speed of 100 and duplex full per the speed and
duplex commands in Example 7-1. However, it also states that Fa0/1 has a status of notconnect, meaning that the interface is not currently working. (That switch port did not
have a cable connected when collecting this example, on purpose.)
FastEthernet 0/2 (Fa0/2): Example 7-1 did not configure this port at all. This port had all
default configuration. Note that the “auto” text under the speed and duplex heading means
that this port will attempt to autonegotiate both settings when the port comes up. However,
this port also does not have a cable connected (again on purpose, for comparison).
FastEthernet 0/4 (Fa0/4): Like Fa0/2, this port has all default configuration but was cabled
to another working device to give yet another contrasting example. This device completed
the autonegotiation process, so instead of “auto” under the speed and duplex headings,
the output lists the negotiated speed and duplex (a-full and a-100). Note that the text
includes the a- to mean that the listed speed and duplex values were autonegotiated.
Configuring Multiple Interfaces with the interface range Command
The bottom of the configuration in Example 7-1 shows a way to shorten your configuration
work when making the same setting on multiple consecutive interfaces. To do so, use the
interface range command. In the example, the interface range FastEthernet 0/11 - 20 command tells IOS that the next subcommand(s) apply to interfaces Fa0/11 through Fa0/20. You
can define a range as long as all interfaces are the same type and are numbered consecutively.
NOTE This book spells out all parameters fully to avoid confusion. However, most everyone abbreviates what they type in the CLI to the shortest unique abbreviation. For instance,
the configuration commands int f0/1 and int ran f0/11 - 20 would also be acceptable.
IOS does not actually put the interface range command into the configuration. Instead,
it acts as if you had typed the subcommand under every single interface in the specified

range. Example 7-3 shows an excerpt from the show running-config command, listing the
configuration of interfaces F0/11–12 from the configuration in Example 7-1. The example
shows the same description command on both interfaces; to save space, the example does
not bother to show all 10 interfaces that have the same description text.

Administratively Controlling Interface State with shutdown
As you might imagine, network engineers need a way to bring down an interface without
having to travel to the switch and remove a cable. In short, we need to be able to decide
which ports should be enabled and which should be disabled.
In an odd turn of phrase, Cisco uses two interface subcommands to configure the idea of
administratively enabling and disabling an interface: the shutdown command (to disable) and
the no shutdown command (to enable). While the no shutdown command might seem like
an odd command to enable an interface at first, you will use this command a lot in the lab,
and it will become second nature. (Most people, in fact, use the abbreviations shut and no
shut.)
Example 7-4 shows an example of disabling an interface using the shutdown interface subcommand. In this case, switch SW1 has a working interface F0/1. The user connects at the
console and disables the interface. IOS generates a log message each time an interface fails or
recovers, and log messages appear at the console, as shown in the example.
Example 7-4 Administratively Disabling an Interface with shutdown
SW1# configure terminal
Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.
SW1(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/1
SW1(config-if)# shutdown
SW1(config-if)#
*Mar 2 03:02:19.701: %LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/1, changed state to
administratively down
*Mar 2 03:02:20.708: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface FastEthernet0/1,
changed state to down
To bring the interface back up again, all you have to do is follow the same process but use
the no shutdown command instead.
Before leaving the simple but oddly named shutdown/no shutdown commands, take a look
at two important show commands that list the status of a shutdown interface. The show
||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
ptg29743230
156    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
interfaces status command lists one line of output per interface, and when shut down,
lists the interface status as “disabled.” That makes logical sense to most people. The show
interfaces command (without the status keyword) lists many lines of output per interface,
giving a much more detailed picture of interface status and statistics. With that command,
the interface status comes in two parts, with one part using the phrase “administratively
down,” matching the highlighted log message in Example 7-4.
Example 7-5 shows an example of each of these commands. Note that both examples also
use the F0/1 parameter (short for Fast Ethernet0/1), which limits the output to the messages
about F0/1 only. Also note that F0/1 is still shut down at this point.

Removing Configuration with the no Command
One purpose for the specific commands shown in Part II of the book is to teach you about
that command. In some cases, the commands are not the end goal, and the text is attempting
to teach you something about how the CLI works. This next short topic is more about the
process than about the commands.
With some IOS configuration commands (but not all), you can revert to the default setting by issuing a no version of the command. What does that mean? Let me give you a few
examples:
■ If you earlier had configured speed 100 on an interface, the no speed command on that
same interface reverts to the default speed setting (which happens to be speed auto).
■ Same idea with the duplex command: an earlier configuration of duplex half or duplex
full, followed by no duplex on the same interface, reverts the configuration back to the
default of duplex auto.
■ If you had configured a description command with some text, to go back to the default
state of having no description command at all for that interface, use the no description
command.
Example 7-6 shows the process. In this case, switch SW1’s F0/2 port has been configured
with speed 100, duplex half, description link to 2901-2, and shutdown. You can see
evidence of all four settings in the command that begins the example. (This command lists
the running-config, but only the part for that one interface.) The example then shows the
no versions of those commands and closes with a confirmation that all the commands have
reverted to default.

NOTE The show running-config and show startup-config commands typically do not display default configuration settings, so the absence of commands listed under interface F0/2
at the end of the example means that those commands now use default values.
Autonegotiation
For any 10/100 or 10/100/1000 interfaces—that is, interfaces that can run at different
speeds—Cisco Catalyst switches default to a setting of duplex auto and speed auto. As a
result, those interfaces attempt to automatically determine the speed and duplex setting to
use. Alternatively, you can configure most devices, switch interfaces included, to use a specific speed and/or duplex.
In practice, using autonegotiation is easy: just leave the speed and duplex at the default setting, and let the switch port negotiate what settings to use on each port. However, problems
can occur due to unfortunate combinations of configuration. Therefore, this next topic walks
through more detail about the concepts behind autonegotiation, so you know better how to
interpret the meaning of the switch show commands and when to choose to use a particular
configuration setting.
Autonegotiation Under Working Conditions
Ethernet devices on the ends of a link must use the same standard; otherwise, they cannot correctly send data. For example, a NIC cannot use 100BASE-T, which uses a two-pair
UTP cable with a 100-Mbps speed, while the switch port on the other end of the link uses
1000BASE-T. Even if you used a cable that works with Gigabit Ethernet, the link would not
work with one end trying to send at 100 Mbps while the other tried to receive the data at
1000 Mbps.
Upgrading to new and faster Ethernet standards becomes a problem because both ends have
to use the same standard. For example, if you replace an old PC with a new one, the old one
might have been using 100BASE-T while the new one uses 1000BASE-T. The switch port on
the other end of the link needs to now use 1000BASE-T, so you upgrade the switch. If that
switch had ports that would use only 1000BASE-T, you would need to upgrade all the other
PCs connected to the switch. So, having both PC network interface cards (NIC) and switch
ports that support multiple standards/speeds makes it much easier to migrate to the next
better standard.

Chapter 7: Configuring and Verifying Switch Interfaces    159
The IEEE autonegotiation protocol helps makes it much easier to operate a LAN when NICs
and switch ports support multiple speeds. IEEE autonegotiation (IEEE standard 802.3u)
defines a protocol that lets the two UTP-based Ethernet nodes on a link negotiate so that
they each choose to use the same speed and duplex settings. The protocol messages flow
outside the normal Ethernet electrical frequencies as out-of-band signals over the UTP cable.
Basically, each node states what it can do, and then each node picks the best options that
both nodes support: the fastest speed and the best duplex setting, with full duplex being
better than half duplex.
NOTE Autonegotiation relies on the fact that the IEEE uses the same wiring pinouts for
10BASE-T and 100BASE-T, and that 1000BASE-T simply adds to those pinouts, adding two
pairs.
Many networks use autonegotiation every day, particularly between user devices and the
access layer LAN switches, as shown in Figure 7-1. The company installed four-pair cabling
of the right quality to support 1000BASE-T, to be ready to support Gigabit Ethernet. As a
result, the wiring supports 10-Mbps, 100-Mbps, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet options. Both
nodes on each link send autonegotiation messages to each other. The switch in this case has
all 10/100/1000 ports, while the PC NICs support different options.

Figure 7-1 IEEE Autonegotiation Results with Both Nodes Working Correctly
The following list breaks down the logic, one PC at a time:
PC1: The switch port claims it can go as fast as 1000 Mbps, but PC1’s NIC claims a top
speed of 10 Mbps. Both the PC and the switch choose the fastest speed that each supports (10 Mbps) and the best duplex that each supports (full).
PC2: PC2 claims a best speed of 100 Mbps, which means it can use 10BASE-T or
100BASE-T. The switch port and NIC negotiate to use the best speed of 100 Mbps and
full duplex.
PC3: It uses a 10/100/1000 NIC, supporting all three speeds and standards, so both the
NIC and switch port choose 1000 Mbps and full duplex.

Autonegotiation Results When Only One Node Uses Autonegotiation
Figure 7-1 shows the IEEE autonegotiation results when both nodes use the process.
However, most Ethernet devices can disable autonegotiation, so it is just as important to
know what happens when a node tries to use autonegotiation but the node gets no response.
Disabling autonegotiation is not always a bad idea. For instance, many network engineers
disable autonegotiation on links between switches and simply configure the desired speed
and duplex on both switches. However, mistakes can happen when one device on an
Ethernet predefines speed and duplex (and disables autonegotiation), while the device on the
other end attempts autonegotiation. In that case, the link might not work at all, or it might
just work poorly.
NOTE Configuring both the speed and duplex on a Cisco Catalyst switch interface disables autonegotiation.
IEEE autonegotiation defines some rules (defaults) that nodes should use as defaults when
autonegotiation fails—that is, when a node tries to use autonegotiation but hears nothing
from the device. The rules:
■ Speed: Use your slowest supported speed (often 10 Mbps).
■ Duplex: If your speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full duplex.
Cisco switches can make a better choice than that base IEEE speed default because Cisco
switches can actually sense the speed used by other nodes, even without IEEE autonegotiation. As a result, Cisco switches use this slightly different logic to choose the speed when
autonegotiation fails:
■ Speed: Sense the speed (without using autonegotiation), but if that fails, use the IEEE
default (slowest supported speed, often 10 Mbps).
■ Duplex: Use the IEEE defaults: If speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full
duplex.
NOTE Ethernet interfaces using speeds faster than 1 Gbps always use full duplex.
Figure 7-2 shows three examples in which three users change their NIC settings and disable
autonegotiation, while the switch (with all 10/100/1000 ports) attempts autonegotiation.
That is, the switch ports all default to speed auto and duplex auto. The top of the figure
shows the configured settings on each PC NIC, with the choices made by the switch listed
next to each switch port.

Figure 7-2 IEEE Autonegotiation Results with Autonegotiation Disabled on One Side
Reviewing each link, left to right:
■ PC1: The switch receives no autonegotiation messages, so it senses the electrical signal
to learn that PC1 is sending data at 100 Mbps. The switch uses the IEEE default duplex
based on the 100 Mbps speed (half duplex).
■ PC2: The switch uses the same steps and logic as with the link to PC1, except that the
switch chooses to use full duplex because the speed is 1000 Mbps.
■ PC3: The user picks poorly, choosing the slower speed (10 Mbps) and the worse duplex
setting (half). However, the Cisco switch senses the speed without using IEEE autonegotiation and then uses the IEEE duplex default for 10-Mbps links (half duplex).
PC1 shows a classic and unfortunately common end result: a duplex mismatch. The two
nodes (PC1 and SW1’s port G0/1) both use 100 Mbps, so they can send data. However, PC1,
using full duplex, does not attempt to use carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) logic and sends frames at any time. Switch port F0/1, with half duplex,
does use CSMA/CD. As a result, switch port F0/1 will believe collisions occur on the link,
even if none physically occur. The switch port will stop transmitting, back off, resend
frames, and so on. As a result, the link is up, but it performs poorly. The upcoming section
titled “Interface Speed and Duplex Issues” will revisit this problem with a focus on how to
recognize the symptoms of a duplex mismatch.
Autonegotiation and LAN Hubs
LAN hubs also impact how autonegotiation works. Basically, hubs do not react to autonegotiation messages, and they do not forward the messages. As a result, devices connected to a
hub must use the IEEE rules for choosing default settings, which often results in the devices
using 10 Mbps and half duplex.
Figure 7-3 shows an example of a small Ethernet LAN that uses a 20-year-old 10BASE-T
hub. In this LAN, all devices and switch ports are 10/100/1000 ports. The hub supports only
10BASE-T.

Note that the devices on the right need to use half duplex because the hub requires the use
of the CSMA/CD algorithm to avoid collisions.

older LAN hubs, look to the companion website for Appendix K, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN
Designs,” to the section titled “Ethernet Collision Domains.”
Analyzing Switch Interface Status and Statistics
Now that you have seen some of the ways to configure switch interfaces, the rest of the
chapter takes a closer look at how to verify the interfaces work correctly. This section also
looks at those more unusual cases in which the interface is working but not working well, as
revealed by different interface status codes and statistics.
Interface Status Codes and Reasons for Nonworking States
Cisco switches actually use two different sets of interface status codes—one set of two
codes (words) that use the same conventions as do router interface status codes, and another
set with a single code (word). Both sets of status codes can determine whether an interface is
working.
The switch show interfaces and show interfaces description commands list the two-code
status named the line status and protocol status. The line status generally refers to whether
Layer 1 is working, with protocol status generally referring to whether Layer 2 is working.
NOTE This book refers to these two status codes in shorthand by just listing the two
codes with a slash between them, such as up/up.
The single-code interface status corresponds to different combinations of the traditional
two-code interface status codes and can be easily correlated to those codes. For example,
the show interfaces status command lists a single-word state of connected state for
working interfaces, with the same meaning as the two-word up/up state seen with the show
interfaces and show interfaces description commands. Table 7-2 lists the code combinations
and some root causes that could have caused a particular interface status.

up up connected The interface is working.
Examining the notconnect state for a moment, note that this state has many causes that have
been mentioned through this book. For example, using incorrect cabling pinouts, instead
of the correct pinouts explained in Chapter 2, “Fundamentals of Ethernet LANs,” causes a
problem. However, one topic can be particularly difficult to troubleshoot—the possibility
for both speed and duplex mismatches, as explained in the next section.
As you can see in the table, having a bad cable is just one of many reasons for the down/down
state (or notconnect, per the show interfaces status command). Some examples of the root
causes of cabling problems include the following:
■ The installation of any equipment that uses electricity, even non-IT equipment, can interfere with the transmission on the cabling and make the link fail.
■ The cable could be damaged, for example, if it lies under carpet. If the user’s chair keeps
squashing the cable, eventually the electrical signal can degrade.
■ Although optical cables do not suffer from electromagnetic interference (EMI), someone
can try to be helpful and move a fiber-optic cable out of the way—bending it too much.
A bend into too tight a shape can prevent the cable from transmitting bits (called macrobending).
For the other interface states listed in Table 7-2, only the up/up (connected) state needs more
discussion. An interface can be in a working state, and it might really be working—or it
might be working in a degraded state. The next few topics discuss how to examine an up/up
(connected) interface to find out whether it is working well or having problems.
Interface Speed and Duplex Issues
To discuss some of the speed and duplex issues, first consider the output from the show
interfaces status and show interfaces commands as demonstrated in Example 7-7. The first
of these commands lists a one-line summary of the interface status, while the second command gives many details—but surprisingly, the briefer show interfaces status command tells
us more about autonegotiation.

Although both commands in the example can be useful, only the show interfaces status
command implies how the switch determined the speed and duplex settings. The command
output lists autonegotiated settings with a prefix of a- and the manually set values without
the a- prefix.
For example, consider ports Fa0/12 and Fa0/13 in the output of the show interfaces status
command. For Fa0/13, a-full means full duplex as autonegotiated, whereas half on Fa0/12
means half duplex but as manually configured. The example shades the command output
that implies that the switch’s Fa0/12 interface’s speed and duplex were not found through
autonegotiation, but Fa0/13 did use autonegotiation.
In comparison, note that the show interfaces fa0/13 command (without the status option)
simply lists the speed and duplex for interface Fast Ethernet 0/13, with nothing implying that
the values were learned through autonegotiation.
When the IEEE autonegotiation process works on both devices—that is, both are sending autonegotiation messages—both devices agree to the fastest speed and best duplex
supported by both devices. However, when one device uses autonegotiation and the other
disables it, the first device must resort to default settings as detailed earlier in section
“Autonegotiation Results When Only One Node Uses Autonegotiation.” As a reminder,
those defaults are
■ Speed: Sense the speed (without using autonegotiation), but if that fails, use the IEEE
default (slowest supported speed, often 10 Mbps).
■ Duplex: Use the IEEE defaults: If speed = 10 or 100, use half duplex; otherwise, use full
duplex.
When a switch must use its defaults, it should get the speed correct, but it may choose the
wrong duplex setting, creating a duplex mismatch.
For example, in Figure 7-4, imagine that SW2’s Gi0/2 interface was configured with the
speed 100 and duplex full commands (these settings are not recommended on a Gigabitcapable interface, by the way). On Cisco switches, configuring both the speed and duplex
commands disables IEEE autonegotiation on that port. If SW1’s Gi0/1 interface tries to use
autonegotiation, SW1 would also use a speed of 100 Mbps, but default to use half duplex.
Example 7-8 shows the results of this specific case on SW1.

Example 7-8 Confirming Duplex Mismatch on Switch SW1
SW1# show interfaces gi0/1 status
Port Name Status Vlan Duplex Speed Type
Gi0/1 connected trunk a-half a-100 10/100/1000BaseTX
First, note that even though SW1 had to use an autonegotiation default, the show interfaces
status command still shows the speed and duplex with the a- prefix. SW2’s port was manually set to 100/Full, so SW1 sensed the speed and runs at 100 Mbps; however, the autonegotiation rules then tell SW1 to use half duplex, as confirmed by the output in Example 7-8.
The output does not identify the duplex mismatch in any way; in fact, finding a duplex
mismatch can be much more difficult than finding a speed mismatch. For instance, if you
purposefully set the speed on the link in Figure 7-4 to be 10 Mbps on one switch and 100
Mbps on the other, both switches would list the port in a down/down or notconnect state.
However, in the case shown in Example 7-8, with a duplex mismatch, if the duplex settings
do not match on the ends of an Ethernet segment, the switch interface will still be in a
connected (up/up) or connected state.
Not only does the show command give an appearance that the link has no issues, but the
link will likely work poorly, with symptoms of intermittent problems. The reason is that the
device using half duplex (SW1 in this case) uses carrier sense multiple access collision detect
(CSMA/CD) logic, waiting to send when receiving a frame, believing collisions occur when
they physically do not—and actually stopping sending a frame because the switch thinks a
collision occurred. With enough traffic load, the interface could be in a connect state, but
it’s extremely inefficient for passing traffic.
To identify duplex mismatch problems, check the duplex setting on each end of the link to
see if the values mismatch. You can also watch for incrementing collision and late collision
counters, as explained in the next section.
Common Layer 1 Problems on Working Interfaces
When the interface reaches the connect (up/up) state, the switch considers the interface to
be working. The switch, of course, tries to use the interface, and at the same time, the switch
keeps various interface counters. These interface counters can help identify problems that
can occur even though the interface is in a connect state, like issues related to the duplex
mismatch problem that was just described. This section explains some of the related concepts and a few of the most common problems.
Whenever the physical transmission has problems, the receiving device might receive a frame
whose bits have changed values. These frames do not pass the error detection logic as implemented in the FCS field in the Ethernet trailer, as covered in Chapter 2. The receiving device
discards the frame and counts it as some kind of input error. Cisco switches list this error as
a CRC error, as highlighted in Example 7-9. (Cyclic redundancy check [CRC] is a term related
to how the frame check sequence [FCS] math detects an error.)

The number of input errors and the number of CRC errors are just a few of the counters in
the output of the show interfaces command. The challenge is to decide which counters you
need to think about, which ones show that a problem is happening, and which ones are normal and of no concern.
The example highlights several of the counters as examples so that you can start to understand which ones point to problems and which ones are just counting normal events that are
not problems. The following list shows a short description of each highlighted counter, in the
order shown in the example:
Runts: Frames that did not meet the minimum frame size requirement (64 bytes, including
the 18-byte destination MAC, source MAC, type, and FCS). Can be caused by collisions.
Giants: Frames that exceed the maximum frame size requirement (1518 bytes, including
the 18-byte destination MAC, source MAC, type, and FCS).
Input Errors: A total of many counters, including runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame,
overrun, and ignored counts.
CRC: Received frames that did not pass the FCS math; can be caused by collisions.
Frame: Received frames that have an illegal format, for example, ending with a partial
byte; can be caused by collisions.
Packets Output: Total number of packets (frames) forwarded out the interface.
Output Errors: Total number of packets (frames) that the switch port tried to transmit,
but for which some problem occurred.
Collisions: Counter of all collisions that occur when the interface is transmitting a frame.
Late Collisions: The subset of all collisions that happen after the 64th byte of the frame
has been transmitted. (In a properly working Ethernet LAN, collisions should occur within
the first 64 bytes; late collisions today often point to a duplex mismatch.)
Note that many of these counters occur as part of the CSMA/CD process used when half
duplex is enabled. Collisions occur as a normal part of the half-duplex logic imposed by
CSMA/CD, so a switch interface with an increasing collisions counter might not even have a
||||||||||||||||||||

ptg29743230
168    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
problem. However, one problem, called late collisions, points to the classic duplex mismatch
problem.
If a LAN design follows cabling guidelines, all collisions should occur by the end of the
64th byte of any frame. When a switch has already sent 64 bytes of a frame, and the switch
receives a frame on that same interface, the switch senses a collision. In this case, the collision is a late collision, and the switch increments the late collision counter in addition to the
usual CSMA/CD actions to send a jam signal, wait a random time, and try again.
With a duplex mismatch, like the mismatch between SW1 and SW2 in Figure 7-4, the halfduplex interface will likely see the late collisions counter increment. Why? The half-duplex
interface sends a frame (SW1), but the full-duplex neighbor (SW2) sends at any time, even
after the 64th byte of the frame sent by the half-duplex switch. So, just keep repeating the
show interfaces command, and if you see the late collisions counter incrementing on a halfduplex interface, you might have a duplex mismatch problem.
A working interface (in an up/up state) can still suffer from issues related to the physical
cabling as well. The cabling problems might not be bad enough to cause a complete failure,
but the transmission failures result in some frames failing to pass successfully over the cable.
For example, excessive interference on the cable can cause the various input error counters
to keep growing larger, especially the CRC counter. In particular, if the CRC errors grow, but
the collisions counters do not, the problem might simply be interference on the cable. (The
switch counts each collided frame as one form of input error as well.)

with VLAN configuration and VLAN trunking configuration. Also, spend some time
changing interface settings like speed and duplex on a link between two switches, to
make sure that you understand which cases would result in a duplex mismatch.
Review Appendix P on the Companion Website
The previous edition of the CCNA exam blueprint included the word “troubleshoot”
as applied to Ethernet and VLANs, while the current CCNA exam blueprint does not.
Appendix P on the companion website contains a chapter from the previous edition of the

Part II of this book introduces the basics of Ethernet LANs, both in concept and in how
to implement the features. However, the two primary features discussed in Part III of this
book—Virtual LANs (VLANs) and Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)—impact almost everything you have learned about Ethernet so far. VLANs allow a network engineer to create
separate Ethernet LANs through simple configuration choices. The ability to separate some
switch ports into one VLAN and other switch ports into another VLAN gives network
designers a powerful tool for creating networks. Once created, VLANs also have a huge
impact on how a switch works, which then impacts how you verify and troubleshoot the
operation of a campus LAN.
STP—and the related and similar Rapid STP (RSTP)—acts to prevent frames from looping
around a LAN. Without STP or RSTP, in LANs with redundant links, broadcasts and some
other frames would be forwarded around and around the LAN, eventually clogging the
LAN so much as to make it unusable.
The current CCNA 200-301 exam blueprint includes exam topics for the configuration
and verification of VLANs and related topics. However, the CCNA exam topics only mention RSTP concepts rather than configuration/verification. To that end, Part III opens with
Chapter 8, which goes to the configuration/verification depth with VLAN topics, followed
by Chapter 9, which introduces the concepts of STP and RSTP.
Part III closes with Chapter 10, which includes some RSTP configuration, along with Layer 2
EtherChannel configuration.
Other Resources
As one additional suggestion for those who intend to move on to CCNP Enterprise, consider skimming or reading Appendix P, “LAN Troubleshooting,” found on the online companion website. This appendix, a copy of a chapter from the previous edition of the book,
takes a troubleshooting approach to many of the topics found in Parts II and III of this
book. Although Cisco completely removed the word troubleshoot from the CCNA exam
blueprint in its current CCNA 200-301 version, the topics still remain relevant and can be a
help for reviewing and refining what you learned in Parts II and III of this book.
