Chapter 9, “Device Management Protocols,” must be enabled on an interface for a voice
access port to work with Cisco IP phones. Cisco switches and routers enable CDP by
default, so its configuration is not shown here.
The following list details the configuration steps for easier review and study:
Step 1. Use the vlan vlan-id command in global configuration mode to create the data
and voice VLANs if they do not already exist on the switch.
Step 2. Configure the data VLAN like an access VLAN, as usual:
A. Use the interface type number command global configuration mode to
move into interface configuration mode.
B. Use the switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configuration
mode to define the data VLAN.
C. Use the switchport mode access command in interface configuration mode
to make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not trunk).
Step 3. Use the switchport voice vlan id-number command in interface configuration
mode to set the voice VLAN ID.

Checklist
Verifying the status of a switch port configured like Example 8-8 shows some different
output compared to the pure access port and pure trunk port configurations seen earlier in
this chapter. For example, the show interfaces switchport command shows details about
the operation of an interface, including many details about access ports. Example 8-9 shows
those details for port F0/4 after the configuration in Example 8-8 was added.
Example 8-9 Verifying the Data VLAN (Access VLAN) and Voice VLAN
Example end.
Working through the first three highlighted lines in the output, all those details should look
familiar for any access port. The switchport mode access configuration command statically
configures the administrative mode to be an access port, so the port of course operates as an
access port. Also, as shown in the third highlighted line, the switchport access vlan 10 configuration
command defined the access mode VLAN as highlighted here.
The fourth highlighted line shows the one small new piece of information: the voice VLAN
ID, as set with the switchport voice vlan 11 command in this case. This small line of output
is the only piece of information in the output that differs from the earlier access port
examples in this chapter.
These ports act more like access ports than trunk ports. In fact, the show interfaces
type number switchport command boldly proclaims, “Operational Mode: static access.”
However, one other show command reveals just a little more about the underlying operation
with 802.1Q tagging for the voice frames.
As mentioned earlier, the show interfaces trunk command—that is, the command that does
not include a specific interface in the middle of the command—lists the operational trunks
on a switch. With IP telephony ports, the ports do not show up in the list of trunks either—
providing evidence that these links are not treated as trunks. Example 8-10 shows just such
an example.
However, the show interfaces trunk command with the interface listed in the middle of the
command, as is also shown in Example 8-10, does list some additional information. Note that
in this case, the show interfaces F0/4 trunk command lists the status as not-trunking, but
with VLANs 10 and 11 allowed on the trunk. (Normally, on an access port, only the access
VLAN is listed in the “VLANs allowed on the trunk” list in the output of this command.)

##### Summary: IP Telephony Ports on Switches
It might seem as though this short topic about IP telephony and switch configuration
includes a lot of small twists and turns and trivia, and it does. The most important items to
remember are as follows:
¦ Configure these ports like a normal access port to begin: Configure it as a static access
port and assign it an access VLAN.
¦ Add one more command to define the voice VLAN (switchport voice vlan vlan-id).
¦ Look for the mention of the voice VLAN ID, but no other new facts, in the output of the
show interfaces type number switchport command.
¦ Look for both the voice and data (access) VLAN IDs in the output of the show interfaces
type number trunk command.
¦ Do not expect to see the port listed in the list of operational trunks as listed by the show
interfaces trunk command.
### Troubleshooting VLANs and VLAN Trunks
A switch’s data plane forwarding processes depend in part on VLANs and VLAN trunking.
This final section of the chapter focuses on issues related to VLANs and VLAN trunks that
could prevent LAN switching from working properly, focusing on a few items not yet discussed
in the chapter. In particular, this section examines these steps an engineer can take to
avoid issues:
Step 1. Confirm that all VLANs are both defined and active.
Step 2. Check the allowed VLAN lists on both ends of each trunk to ensure that all
VLANs intended to be used are included.
Step 3. Check for incorrect trunk configuration settings that result in one switch operating
as a trunk, with the neighboring switch not operating as a trunk.
Step 4. Check the native VLAN settings on both ends of the trunk to ensure the settings
match.
#### Access VLANs Undefined or Disabled
Switches do not forward frames for VLANs that are (a) not known because the VLAN is not
configured or has not been learned with VTP or (b) the VLAN is known, but it is disabled
(shut down). This next topic summarizes the best ways to confirm that a switch knows that a
particular VLAN exists, and if it exists, determines the shutdown state of the VLAN.
First, on the issue of whether a VLAN exists on a switch, a VLAN can be defined to a
switch in two ways: using the vlan number global configuration command, or it can be
learned from another switch using VTP. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the examples in
this book assume that you are not using VTP. If you discover that a VLAN does not exist on
a switch, simply configure the VLAN as discussed earlier in the section, “Creating VLANs
and Assigning Access VLANs to an Interface.”
In addition to checking the configuration, you can check for the status of the VLAN (as well
as whether it is known to the switch) using the show vlan command. No matter the VTP
mode, this command will list all VLANs known to the switch, plus one of two VLAN state
values, depending on the current state: either active or act/lshut. The second of these states
means that the VLAN is shut down. Shutting down a VLAN disables the VLAN on that
switch only, so the switch will not forward frames in that VLAN.
Switch IOS gives you two similar configuration methods with which to disable (shutdown)
and enable (no shutdown) a VLAN. Example 8-11 shows how, first by using the global
command [no] shutdown vlan number and then using the VLAN mode subcommand [no]
shutdown. The example shows the global commands enabling and disabling VLANs 10 and
20, respectively, and using VLAN subcommands to enable and disable VLANs 30 and 40,
respectively.
