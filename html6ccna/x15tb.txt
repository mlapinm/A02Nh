Welcome to the first chapter in your study for CCNA! This chapter begins Part I, which
focuses on the basics of networking.
Networks work correctly because the various devices and software follow the rules. Those
rules come in the form of standards and protocols, which are agreements of a particular
part of how a network should work. However, the sheer number of standards and protocols
available can make it difficult for the average network engineer to think about and work
with networksâ€”so the world of networking has used several networking models over time.
Networking models define a structure and different categories (layers) of standards and protocols. As new standards and protocols emerge over time, networkers can think of those new
details in the context of a working model.
