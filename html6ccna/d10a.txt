RSTP and EtherChannel
Configuration
This chapter covers the following exam topics:
2.0 Network Access
2.4 Configure and verify (Layer 2/Layer 3) EtherChannel (LACP)
2.5 Describe the need for and basic operations of Rapid PVST+ Spanning Tree Protocol
and identify basic operations
2.5.a Root port, root bridge (primary/secondary), and other port names
2.5.b Port states (forwarding/blocking)
2.5.c PortFast benefits
This chapter shows how to configure Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) and Layer 2
EtherChannels. The EtherChannel content, in the second major section of the chapter, follows
a typical flow for most configuration/verification topics in a certification guide: it reviews
concepts, shows configurations, and provides show commands that point out the configuration
settings and operational state. The details include how to manually configure a channel, how to
cause a switch to dynamically create a channel, and how EtherChannel load distribution works.
The first section of the chapter explores RSTP implementation taking a different approach.
Cisco mentions RSTP concepts, but not configuration/verification, in the CCNA exam topics. However, to get a real sense of RSTP concepts, especially some concepts specific to
Cisco Catalyst switches, you need to work with RSTP configuration and verification. The
first section of the chapter explores RSTP implementation, but as a means to the end of more
fully understanding RSTP concepts.
For those of you who, like me, probably would want to go ahead and practice configuring
RSTP, do some show commands, and understand more fully, you do have some options:
■ Read Appendix O, “Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation,” from this book’s companion website. The appendix is a chapter from the previous edition of this book, with full
details of configuration/verification of STP and RSTP.
■ Use the STP/RSTP config labs on my blog site (as regularly listed in the Chapter Review
section of each chapter).
“Do I Know This Already?” Quiz
Take the quiz (either here or use the PTP software) if you want to use the score to help you
decide how much time to spend on this chapter. The letter answers are listed at the bottom
of the page following the quiz. Appendix C, found both at the end of the book as well as on
the companion website, includes both the answers and explanations. You can also find both
answers and explanations in the PTP testing software.

Understanding RSTP Through Configuration
Cisco IOS switches today typically default to using RSTP rather than STP, with default settings so that RSTP works with no configuration. You can buy some Cisco switches and connect them with Ethernet cables in a redundant topology, and RSTP will ensure that frames
do not loop. And even if some switches use RSTP and some use STP, the switches can
interoperate and still build a working spanning tree—and you never even have to think about
changing any settings!
Although RSTP works without any configuration, most medium-size to large-size campus
LANs benefit from some STP configuration. For instance, Figure 10-1 shows a typical LAN
design model, with two distribution layer switches (D1 and D2). The design may have dozens of access layer switches that connect to end users; the figure shows just three access
switches (A1, A2, and A3). For a variety of reasons, most network engineers make the distribution layer switches be the root.

NOTE Cisco uses the term access switch to refer to switches used to connect to endpoint
devices. The term distribution switch refers to switches that do not connect to endpoints
but rather connect to each access switch, providing a means to distribute frames throughout the LAN. If you want to read more about LAN design concepts and terms, refer to this
book’s companion website for Appendix K, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN Designs.”
As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, this first section of the chapter examines
a variety of STP/RSTP configuration topics, but with a goal of revealing a few more details
about how STP and RSTP operate. Following this opening section about RSTP configuration,
the next section examines how to configure Layer 2 EtherChannels, and how that impacts
STP/RSTP.
The Need for Multiple Spanning Trees
The IEEE first standardized STP as the IEEE 802.1D standard, first published back in 1990.
To put some perspective on that date, Cisco did not have a LAN switch product line at the
time, and virtual LANs did not exist yet. Instead of multiple VLANs in a physical Ethernet
LAN, the physical Ethernet LAN existed as one single broadcast domain, with one instance
of STP.
By the mid 1990s, VLANs had appeared on the scene, along with LAN switches. The emergence of VLANs posed a challenge for STP—the only type of STP available at the time—
because STP defined a single common spanning tree (CST) topology for the entire LAN. The
IEEE needed an option to create multiple spanning trees so that traffic could be balanced
across the available links, as shown in Figure 10-2. With two different STP instances, SW3
could block on a different interface in each VLAN, as shown in the figure.

STP Modes and Standards
Because of the sequence of events over the history of the various STP family of protocols,
vendors like Cisco needed to create their own proprietary features to create the per-VLAN
spanning tree concept shown in Figure 10-2. That sequence resulted in the following:
■ When STP was the only STP standard back in the 1990s with 802.1D, Cisco created the
STP-based Per VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+) protocol, which creates one spanning
tree instance per VLAN.
■ When the IEEE introduced RSTP (in 802.1D amendment 802.1w, in the year 2001), Cisco
also created the Rapid PVST+ (RPVST+) protocol. RPVST+ provided more features than
standardized RSTP, including one tree per VLAN.
■ The IEEE did not adopt Cisco’s PVST+ or RPVST+ into their standards to create multiple
spanning trees. Instead, the IEEE created a different method: Multiple Spanning Tree
Protocol (MSTP), originally defined in 802.1Q amendment 802.1s.
Figure 10-3 shows the features as a timeline for perspective.

Today, Cisco Catalyst switches give us three options to configure on the spanning-tree
mode command, which tells the switch which type of STP to use. Note that the switches
do not support STP or RSTP with the single tree (CST). They can use either the Ciscoproprietary and STP-based PVST+, Cisco-proprietary and RSTP-based RPVST+, or the IEEE
standard MSTP. Table 10-2 summarizes some of the facts about these standards and options,

The Bridge ID and System ID Extension
To support the idea of multiple spanning trees, whether one per VLAN or simply multiple as
created with MSTP, the protocols must consider the VLANs and VLAN trunking. (That’s one
reason why RSTP and MSTP now exist as part of the 802.1Q standard, which defines VLANs
and VLAN trunking.) To help make that work, the IEEE redefined the format of the original
BID value to help make per-VLAN instances of STP/RSTP become a reality.
Originally, a switch’s BID was formed by combining the switch’s 2-byte priority and its
6-byte MAC address. The revised rules divide the original priority field into two separate
fields, as shown in Figure 10-4: a 4-bit priority field and a 12-bit subfield called the system
ID extension (which represents the VLAN ID).

Cisco switches let you configure the BID, but only the priority part. The switch fills in its
universal (burned-in) MAC address as the system ID. It also plugs in the VLAN ID of a
VLAN in the 12-bit system ID extension field; you cannot change that behavior either. The
only part configurable by the network engineer is the 4-bit priority field.
However, configuring the number to put in the priority field may be one of the strangest
things to configure on a Cisco router or switch. As shown at the top of Figure 10-4, the
priority field was originally a 16-bit number, which represented a decimal number from 0
to 65,535. Because of that history, the configuration command (spanning-tree vlan vlan-id
priority x) requires a decimal number between 0 and 65,535. But not just any number in that
range will suffice; it must be a multiple of 4096, as emphasized in the help text shown in
Example 10-2.
Example 10-2 Help Shows Requirements for Using Increments of 4096 for Priority
SW1(config)# spanning-tree vlan 1 priority ?
 <0-61440> bridge priority in increments of 4096
SW1(config)#
Table 10-3 lists all the configurable values for the STP/RSTP priority. However, do not worry
about memorizing the values. Instead, the table lists the values to emphasize two points
about the binary values: the first 4 bits in each value differ, but the last 12 bits remain as 12
binary zeros.

Note that while you can set the priority to any of the 16 decimal values in Table 10-3, Cisco
provides a convenient means to create a primary and secondary root switch concept without configuring an actual number. In most LAN designs, only a small number of switches
would be good candidates to ever be the root switch based on where the switches sit within
the topology. Think of the preferred switch as the primary switch and the next-best option
as the secondary switch. Then, to configure those two switches to be the two most likely
switches to be the root switch, simply configure
spanning-tree vlan x root primary (on the switch that should be primary)
spanning-tree vlan x root secondary (on the switch that should be secondary)

These two commands cause the switch to make a choice of priority value but then store the
chosen priority value in the spanning-tree vlan x priority value command. The command
with root primary or root secondary does not appear in the configuration. When configuring root primary, the switch looks at the priority of the current root switch and chooses
either (a) 24,576 or (b) 4096 less than the current root’s priority (if the current root’s priority
is 24,576 or less) to the configuration instead. When configuring, root secondary always
results in that switch using a priority of 28,672, with the assumption that the value will be
less than other switches that use the default of 32,768, and higher than any switch configured as root primary.
How Switches Use the Priority and System ID Extension
Cisco Catalyst switches configure the priority value using a number that represents a 16-bit
value; however, the system ID extension exists as the low-order 12 bits of that same number.
This next topic works through connecting those ideas.
When the switch builds its BID to use for RSTP in a VLAN, it must combine the configured
priority with the VLAN ID of that VLAN. Interestingly, the configured priority results in a
16-bit priority that always ends with 12 binary 0s. That fact makes the process of combining
values to create the BID a little simpler for the switch and possibly a little simpler for network engineers once you understand it all.
First, consider the process shown in Figure 10-5. The top shows the configured priority value (decimal 32768), in 16-bit binary form, with a System ID Extension of 12 zeros.
Moving down the figure, you see the binary version of a VLAN ID (decimal 9). At the last
step, the switch replaces those last 12 bits of the System ID Extension with the value that
matches the VLAN ID and uses that value as the first 16 bits of the BID.

16-Bit Priority 1000 0000 0000 1001
Figure 10-5 Configured Priority (16-Bit) and System ID Extension (12-Bit) Added
As it turns out, the process shown in Figure 10-5 is just the sum of the two numbers—both
in binary and decimal. To see an example, refer to upcoming Example 10-3, which demonstrates the following details:
■ The output shows details about VLAN 9.
■ The root switch has been configured with the spanning-tree vlan 9 priority 24576
command.
■ The local switch (the switch on which the command was gathered) has been configured
with the spanning-tree vlan 9 priority 32768 command.

246    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
■ Conveniently, the decimal equivalent of the two switches’ first 16 bits—the original
16-bit priority field—can be easily calculated in decimal. In this example:
■ Root Switch: 24,576 (priority) + 9 (VLAN ID) = 24585
■ Local Switch: 32,768 (priority) + 9 (VLAN ID) = 32777
The output in Example 10-3 matches this logic. The top highlight shows the priority of the
root switch (24585), which is the sum of the root switch’s priority setting (configured as
24,576) plus 9 for the VLAN ID. The second highlight shows a value of 32,777, calculated as
the local switch’s priority setting of 32,768 plus 9 for the VLAN ID.

RSTP Methods to Support Multiple Spanning Trees
Although the history and configuration might make the BID priority idea seem a bit convoluted, having an extra 12-bit field in the BID works well in practice because it can be used to
identify the VLAN ID. VLAN IDs range from 1 to 4094, requiring 12 bits.
For the purposes of discussion, focus on the standard RSTP and its Cisco-proprietary cousin
RPVST+. Both use the RSTP mechanisms as discussed in Chapter 9, “Spanning Tree Protocol
Concepts,” but RPVST+ uses the mechanisms for every VLAN, while standard RSTP does
not. So how do their methods differ?
■ RSTP creates one tree—the Common Spanning Tree (CST)—while RPVST+ creates one
tree for each and every VLAN.
■ RSTP sends one set of RSTP messages (BPDUs) in the network, no matter the number of
VLANs, while RPVST+ sends one set of messages per VLAN.
■ RSTP and RPVST+ use different destination MAC addresses: RSTP with multicast address
0180.C200.0000 (an address defined in the IEEE standard), and RPVST+ with multicast
address 0100.0CCC.CCCD (an address chosen by Cisco).
■ When transmitting messages on VLAN trunks, RSTP sends the messages in the native
VLAN with no VLAN header/tag. RPVST+ sends each VLAN’s messages inside that
VLAN—for instance, BPDUs about VLAN 9 have an 802.1Q header that lists VLAN 9.

Chapter 10: RSTP and EtherChannel Configuration    247
■ RPVST+ adds an extra type-length value (TLV) to the BPDU that identifies the VLAN ID,
while RSTP does not (because it does not need to, as RSTP ignores VLANs.)
■ Both view the 16-bit priority as having a 12-bit System ID Extension, with RSTP setting
the value to 0000.0000.0000, meaning “no VLAN,” while RPVST+ uses the VLAN ID.
In other words, standard RSTP behaves as if VLANs do not exist, while Cisco’s RPVST+ integrates VLAN information into the entire process.
NOTE Some documents refer to the feature of sending BPDUs over trunks with VLAN
tags matching the same VLAN as BPDU tunneling.
Other RSTP Configuration Options
This chapter does not attempt to work through all the configuration options available for
RSTP. However, many of the configuration settings may be intuitive now that you know
quite a bit about the protocol. This final topic in the first section of the chapter summarizes
a few of the configuration concepts. As a reminder, for those interested in continuing on to
CCNP Enterprise, you might be interested in reading more about RSTP configuration in the
companion website’s Appendix O, “Spanning Tree Protocol Implementation.”
■ Switch Priority: The global command spanning-tree vlan x priority y lets an engineer
set the switch’s priority in that VLAN.
■ Primary and Secondary Root Switches: The global command spanning-tree vlan x root
primary | secondary also lets you set the priority, but the switch decides on a value to
make that switch likely to be the primary root switch (the root) or the secondary root
switch (the switch that becomes root if the primary fails).
■ Port Costs: The interface subcommand spanning-tree [vlan x] cost y lets an engineer
set the switch’s STP/RSTP cost on that port, either for all VLANs or for a specific VLAN
on that port. Changing those costs then changes the root cost for some switches, which
impacts the choice of root ports and designated ports.
That concludes this chapter’s examination of RSTP configuration—now on to Layer 2
EtherChannel!
Configuring Layer 2 EtherChannel
As introduced in Chapter 9, two neighboring switches can treat multiple parallel links
between each other as a single logical link called an EtherChannel. Without EtherChannel, a
switch treats each physical port as an independent port, applying MAC learning, forwarding,
and STP logic per physical port. With EtherChannel, the switch applies all those same processes to a group of physical ports as one entity: the EtherChannel. Without EtherChannel,
with parallel links between two switches, STP/RSTP would block all links except one, but
with EtherChannel, the switch can use all the links, load balancing the traffic over the links.
NOTE All references to EtherChannel in this chapter refer to Layer 2 EtherChannels, not
to Layer 3 EtherChannels (as discussed in Chapter 17, “IP Routing in the LAN”). CCNA
200-301 exam topics include both Layer 2 and Layer 3 EtherChannels.

EtherChannel may be one of the most challenging switch features to make work. First, the
configuration has several options, so you have to remember the details of which options
work together. Second, the switches also require a variety of other interface settings to
match among all the links in the channel, so you have to know those settings as well.
This section shows how to configure a Layer 2 EtherChannel, first through manual (static)
configuration, and then by allowing dynamic protocols to create the channel. This section
closes with some information about some common configuration issues that occur with
Layer 2 EtherChannels.
Configuring a Manual Layer 2 EtherChannel
To configure a Layer 2 EtherChannel so that all the ports always attempt to be part of the
channel, simply add the correct channel-group configuration command to each physical
interface, on each switch, all with the on keyword, and all with the same number. The on
keyword tells the switches to place a physical interface into an EtherChannel, and the number identifies the PortChannel interface number that the interface should be a part of.
Before getting into the configuration and verification, however, you need to start using
three terms as synonyms: EtherChannel, PortChannel, and Channel-group. Oddly, IOS
uses the channel-group configuration command, but then to display its status, IOS uses the
show etherchannel command. Then the output of this show command refers to neither an
“EtherChannel” nor a “Channel-group,” instead using the term “PortChannel.” So, pay close
attention to these three terms in the example.
To configure an EtherChannel manually, follow these steps:
Step 1. Add the channel-group number mode on command in interface configuration
mode under each physical interface that should be in the channel to add it to
the channel.
Step 2. Use the same number for all commands on the same switch, but the channelgroup number on the neighboring switch can differ.
Example 10-4 shows a simple example, with two links between switches SW1 and SW2, as
shown in Figure 10-6. The configuration shows SW1’s two interfaces placed into channelgroup 1, with two show commands to follow.

an interface. This interface exists because of the channel-group commands using the
1 parameter. STP no longer operates on physical interfaces Fa0/14 and Fa0/15, instead
operating on the PortChannel1 interface, so only that interface is listed in the output.
Next, note the output of the show etherchannel 1 summary command. It lists as a heading
“Port-channel,” with Po1 below it. It also lists both Fa0/14 and Fa0/15 in the list of ports,
with a (P) beside each. Per the legend, the P means that the ports are bundled in the port
channel, which is a code that means these ports have passed all the configuration checks and
are valid to be included in the channel.
Configuring Dynamic EtherChannels
In addition to manual configuration, Cisco switches also support two different configuration
options that then use a dynamic protocol to negotiate whether a particular link becomes
part of an EtherChannel or not. Basically, the configuration enables a protocol for a particular channel-group number. At that point, the switch can use the protocol to send messages
to/from the neighboring switch and discover whether their configuration settings pass all
checks. If a given physical link passes, the link is added to the EtherChannel and used; if
not, it is placed in a down state, and not used, until the configuration inconsistency can be
resolved.
Most Cisco Catalyst switches support the Cisco-proprietary Port Aggregation Protocol
(PAgP) and the IEEE standard Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), based on IEEE
standard 802.3ad. Although differences exist between the two, to the depth discussed here,
they both accomplish the same task: negotiate so that only links that pass the configuration
checks are actually used in an EtherChannel.
One difference of note is that LACP does support more links in a channel—16—as compared to PaGP’s maximum of 8. With LACP, only 8 can be active at one time, with the others waiting to be used should any of the other links fail.
To configure either protocol, a switch uses the channel-group configuration commands on
each switch, but with a keyword that either means “use this protocol and begin negotiations” or “use this protocol and wait for the other switch to begin negotiations.” As shown
in Figure 10-7, the desirable and auto keywords enable PAgP, and the active and passive
keywords enable LACP. With these options, at least one side has to begin the negotiations.
In other words, with PAgP, at least one of the two sides must use desirable, and with LACP,
at least one of the two sides must use active.

NOTE Do not use the on parameter on one end, and either auto or desirable (or for LACP,
active or passive) on the neighboring switch. The on option uses neither PAgP nor LACP, so
a configuration that uses on, with PAgP or LACP options on the other end, would prevent
the EtherChannel from working.
For example, in the design shown in Figure 10-7, imagine both physical interfaces on both
switches were configured with the channel-group 2 mode desirable interface subcommand.
As a result, the two switches would negotiate and create an EtherChannel. Example 10-5
shows the verification of that configuration, with the command show etherchannel 1
port-channel. This command confirms the protocol in use (PAgP, because the desirable
keyword was configured), and the list of interfaces in the channel.

Physical Interface Configuration and EtherChannels
Even when the channel-group commands have all been configured correctly, other configuration settings can prevent a switch from using a physical port in an EtherChannel—even physical
ports manually configured to be part of the channel. The next topic examines those reasons.
First, before using a physical port in an EtherChannel, the switch compares the new physical
port’s configuration to the existing ports in the channel. That new physical interface’s
settings must be the same as the existing ports’ settings; otherwise, the switch does not
add the new link to the list of approved and working interfaces in the channel. That is, the
||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
ptg29743230
252    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
physical interface remains configured as part of the PortChannel, but it is not used as part of
the channel, often being placed into some nonworking state.
The list of items the switch checks includes the following:
■ Speed
■ Duplex
■ Operational access or trunking state (all must be access, or all must be trunks)
■ If an access port, the access VLAN
■ If a trunk port, the allowed VLAN list (per the switchport trunk allowed command)
■ If a trunk port, the native VLAN
■ STP interface settings
In addition, switches check the settings on the neighboring switch. To do so, the switches
either use PAgP or LACP (if already in use) or use Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) if using
manual configuration. When checking neighbors, all settings except the STP settings must
match.
As an example, SW1 and SW2 again use two links in one EtherChannel from Figure 10-7.
Before configuring the EtherChannel, SW1’s G0/2 was given a different RSTP port cost than
G0/1. Example 10-6 picks up the story just after configuring the correct channel-group commands, when the switch is deciding whether to use G0/1 and G0/2 in this.

The messages at the top of the example specifically state what the switch does when
determining whether the interface settings match. In this case, SW1 detects the different
STP costs. SW1 does not use G0/1, does not use G0/2, and even places them into an errdisabled state. The switch also puts the PortChannel into err-disabled state. As a result, the
PortChannel is not operational, and the physical interfaces are also not operational.
To solve this problem, you must reconfigure the physical interfaces to use the same STP
settings. In addition, the PortChannel and physical interfaces must be shutdown, and then
no shutdown, to recover from the err-disabled state. (Note that when a switch applies
the shutdown and no shutdown commands to a PortChannel, it applies those same
commands to the physical interfaces, as well; so, just do the shutdown/no shutdown on the
PortChannel interface.)
EtherChannel Load Distribution
When using Layer 2 EtherChannels, a switch’s MAC learning process associates MAC
addresses with the PortChannel interfaces and not the underlying physical ports. Later, when
a switch makes a forwarding decision to send a frame out a PortChannel interface, the switch
must do more work: to decide out which specific physical port to use to forward the frame.
IOS documentation refers to those rules as EtherChannel load distribution or load balancing. Figure 10-8 shows the main idea.

Configuration Options for EtherChannel Load Distribution
EtherChannel load distribution makes the choice for each frame based on various numeric
values found in the Layer 2, 3, and 4 headers. The process uses one configurable setting as
input: the load distribution method as defined with the port-channel load-balance method
global command. The process then performs some match against the fields identified by the
configured method.
Table 10-4 lists the most common methods. However, note that some switches may support
only MAC-based methods, or only MAC- and IP-based methods, depending on the model
and software version.
Table 10-4 EtherChannel Load Distribution Methods
Configuration Keyword Math Uses… Layer
src-mac Source MAC address 2
dst-mac Destination MAC address 2
src-dst-mac Both source and destination MAC 2

dst-ip Destination IP address 3
src-dst-ip Both source and destination IP 3

To appreciate why you might want to use different methods, you need to consider the results
of how switches make their choice. (The discussion here focuses on the result, and not the
logic, because the logic remains internal to the switch, and Cisco does not document how
each switch model or IOS version works internally.) However, the various load distribution
algorithms do share some common goals:
■ To cause all messages in a single application flow to use the same link in the channel,
rather than being sent over different links. Doing so means that the switch will not inadvertently reorder the messages sent in that application flow by sending one message over
a busy link that has a queue of waiting messages, while immediately sending the next
message out an unused link.
■ To integrate the load distribution algorithm work into the hardware forwarding ASIC so
that load distribution works just as quickly as the work to forward any other frame.
■ To use all the active links in the EtherChannel, adjusting to the addition and removal of
active links over time.
■ Within the constraints of the other goals, balance the traffic across those active links.
In short, the algorithms first intend to avoid message reordering, make use of the switch forwarding ASICs, and use all the active links. However, the algorithm does not attempt to send
the exact same number of bits over each link over time. The algorithm does try to balance
the traffic, but always within the constraints of the other goals.

Chapter 10: RSTP and EtherChannel Configuration    255
Whatever load distribution method you choose, the method identifies fields in the message
headers. Any messages in the same application flow will then have the same values in the fields
used by the load distribution algorithm and will always be forwarded over the same link. For
example, when a user connects to a website, that web server may return thousands of packets
to the client. Those thousands of packets should flow over the same link in the EtherChannel.
For instance, with the load distribution method of src-mac (meaning source MAC address),
all frames with the same MAC address flow over one link. Figure 10-9 shows the idea with
pseudo MAC addresses, with the load distribution sending frames with source MAC 1 over
link 1, source MAC 2 over link 2, and source MAC 3 over link 3.

Cisco provides a variety of load distribution options so that the engineer can examine the
flows in the network with the idea of finding which fields have the most variety in their values: source and destination MAC, or IP address, or transport layer port numbers. The more
variety in the values in the fields, the better the balancing effects, and the lower the chance
of sending disproportionate amounts of traffic over one link.
NOTE The algorithm focuses on the low-order bits in the fields in the headers because the
low-order bits typically differ the most in real networks, while the high-order bits do not
differ much. By focusing on the lower-order bits, the algorithm achieves better balancing of
traffic over the links.
The Effects of the EtherChannel Load Distribution Algorithm
Figure 10-10 details a new EtherChannel that will be used in two examples to show the
effects of load distribution. The examples will focus on frames sent by switch SW1 in the
figure, showing the use of the test etherchannel load-balance EXEC command. That command asks the switch to consider some addresses or ports and answer the question: which
link would you use when forwarding a message with those address/port values?

Example 10-7 shows how switch SW1 distributes traffic when using src-mac load distribution. The example lists the output from three of the test etherchannel load-balance commands, but note that all three commands use the same source MAC address. As a result, the
answer from each command references the same interface (G1/0/22 in this case).
Example 10-7 Testing with Identical Source MACs When Using src-mac Balancing
SW1# show etherchannel load-balance
EtherChannel Load-Balancing Configuration:
 src-mac
EtherChannel Load-Balancing Addresses Used Per-Protocol:
Non-IP: Source MAC address

SW1# test etherchannel load-balance interface po1 mac 0200.0000.0001 0200.1111.1113
Would select Gi1/0/22 of Po1
Example 10-7 makes two important points:
■ All three tests list the same outgoing physical interface because (1) the method uses only
the source MAC address, and (2) all three tests use the same MAC addresses.
■ All three tests use a different destination MAC address, with different low-order bits, but
that had no impact on the choice because the method—src-mac—does not consider the
destination MAC address.
In contrast on that first point, Example 10-8 repeats the test commands from Example 10-7.
The switch still uses the src-mac balancing method, but now with different source MAC
addresses in each test. Notice that the source MAC addresses used in the tests differ by
just a few bit values in the low-order bits, so as a result, each test shows a different interface
choice by SW1.
Example 10-8 Testing with Source MACs with Low-Order Bit Differences

Example 10-9 shows yet a third variation, this time changing the load distribution method to
src-dst-mac, which means that the switch will consider both source and destination MAC.
The example repeats the exact same test etherchannel commands as Example 10-7, with the
exact same MAC addresses: the source MAC addresses remain the same in all three tests,
but the destination MAC addresses differ in the low-order bits. With the chosen destination
MAC values differing slightly, switch SW1 happens to choose three different interfaces.

The book makes a big transition at this point. Part I gave you a broad introduction to networking, and Parts II and III went into some detail about the dominant LAN technology
today: Ethernet. Part IV transitions from Ethernet to the network layer details that sit above
Ethernet and WAN technology, specifically IP Version 4 (IPv4).
Thinking about the network layer requires engineers to shift how they think about addressing. Ethernet allows the luxury of using universal MAC addresses, assigned by the manufacturers, with no need to plan or configure addresses. Although the network engineer needs
to understand MAC addresses, MAC already exists on each Ethernet NIC, and switches
learn the Ethernet MAC addresses dynamically without even needing to be configured to
do so. As a result, most people operating the network can ignore the specific MAC address
values for most tasks.
Conversely, IP addressing gives us flexibility and allows choice, but those features require
planning, along with a much deeper understanding of the internal structure of the addresses.
People operating the network must be more aware of the network layer addresses when
doing many tasks. To better prepare you for these Layer 3 addressing details, this part
breaks down the addressing details into four chapters, with an opportunity to learn more in
preparation for the CCNP Enterprise certification.
Part IV examines most of the basic details of IPv4 addressing and subnetting, mostly from
the perspective of operating an IP network. Chapter 11 takes a grand tour of IPv4 addressing as implemented inside a typical enterprise network. Chapters 12, 13, and 14 look at
some of the specific questions people must ask themselves when operating an IPv4 network.
