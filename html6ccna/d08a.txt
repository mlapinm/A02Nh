So far in this book, you have learned that Ethernet switches receive Ethernet frames, make
decisions, and then forward (switch) those Ethernet frames. That core logic revolves around
MAC addresses, the interface in which the frame arrives, and the interfaces out which the
switch forwards the frame.
While true, that logic omits any consideration of virtual LANs (VLANs). VLANs impact the
switching logic for each frame because each VLAN acts as a subset of the switch ports in an
Ethernet LAN. Switches believe each Ethernet frame to be received in an identifiable VLAN,
forwarded based on MAC table entries for that VLAN, and forwarded out ports in that
VLAN. This chapter explores those concepts and others related to VLANs.
As for the organization of the chapter, the first major section of the chapter explains the core
concepts. These concepts include how VLANs work on a single switch, how to use VLAN
trunking to create VLANs that span across multiple switches, and how to forward traffic
between VLANs using a router. The second major section shows how to configure VLANs and
VLAN trunks: how to statically assign interfaces to a VLAN. The final major section discusses
some issues that can arise when using VLANs and trunks and how to avoid those issues.

Foundation Topics
Virtual LAN Concepts
Before understanding VLANs, you must first have a specific understanding of the definition
of a LAN. For example, from one perspective, a LAN includes all the user devices, servers,
switches, routers, cables, and wireless access points in one location. However, an alternative
narrower definition of a LAN can help in understanding the concept of a virtual LAN:
A LAN includes all devices in the same broadcast domain.
A broadcast domain includes the set of all LAN-connected devices, so that when any of the
devices sends a broadcast frame, all the other devices get a copy of the frame. So, from one
perspective, you can think of a LAN and a broadcast domain as being basically the same
thing.
Using only default settings, a switch considers all its interfaces to be in the same broadcast
domain. That is, for one switch, when a broadcast frame entered one switch port, the switch
forwards that broadcast frame out all other ports. With that logic, to create two different
LAN broadcast domains, you had to buy two different Ethernet LAN switches, as shown in
Figure 8-1.

Figure 8-1 Creating Two Broadcast Domains with Two Physical Switches and No VLANs
By using two VLANs, a single switch can accomplish the same goals of the design in Figure
8-1—to create two broadcast domains—with a single switch. With VLANs, a switch can
configure some interfaces into one broadcast domain and some into another, creating multiple broadcast domains. These individual broadcast domains created by the switch are called
virtual LANs (VLAN).
For example, in Figure 8-2, the single switch creates two VLANs, treating the ports in each
VLAN as being completely separate. The switch would never forward a frame sent by Dino
(in VLAN 1) over to either Wilma or Betty (in VLAN 2).

Figure 8-2 Creating Two Broadcast Domains Using One Switch and VLANs
Designing campus LANs to use more VLANs, each with a smaller number of devices, often
helps improve the LAN in many ways. For example, a broadcast sent by one host in a VLAN
will be received and processed by all the other hosts in the VLAN—but not by hosts in a
different VLAN. Limiting the number of hosts that receive a single broadcast frame reduces
the number of hosts that waste effort processing unneeded broadcasts. It also reduces
||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
ptg29743230
180    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
security risks because fewer hosts see frames sent by any one host. These are just a few
reasons for separating hosts into different VLANs. The following list summarizes the most
common reasons for choosing to create smaller broadcast domains (VLANs):
■ To reduce CPU overhead on each device, improving host performance, by reducing the
number of devices that receive each broadcast frame
■ To reduce security risks by reducing the number of hosts that receive copies of frames
that the switches flood (broadcasts, multicasts, and unknown unicasts)
■ To improve security for hosts through the application of different security policies per
VLAN
■ To create more flexible designs that group users by department, or by groups that work
together, instead of by physical location
■ To solve problems more quickly, because the failure domain for many problems is the
same set of devices as those in the same broadcast domain
■ To reduce the workload for the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) by limiting a VLAN to a
single access switch
The rest of this chapter looks closely at the mechanics of how VLANs work across multiple
Cisco switches, including the required configuration. To that end, the next section examines
VLAN trunking, a feature required when installing a VLAN that exists on more than one
LAN switch.
Creating Multiswitch VLANs Using Trunking
Configuring VLANs on a single switch requires only a little effort: you simply configure
each port to tell it the VLAN number to which the port belongs. With multiple switches,
you have to consider additional concepts about how to forward traffic between the switches.
When you are using VLANs in networks that have multiple interconnected switches, the
switches need to use VLAN trunking on the links between the switches. VLAN trunking
causes the switches to use a process called VLAN tagging, by which the sending switch
adds another header to the frame before sending it over the trunk. This extra trunking header
includes a VLAN identifier (VLAN ID) field so that the sending switch can associate the
frame with a particular VLAN ID, and the receiving switch can then know in what VLAN
each frame belongs.
Figure 8-3 shows an example that demonstrates VLANs that exist on multiple switches, but
it does not use trunking. First, the design uses two VLANs: VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. Each
switch has two ports assigned to each VLAN, so each VLAN exists in both switches. To
forward traffic in VLAN 10 between the two switches, the design includes a link between
switches, with that link fully inside VLAN 10. Likewise, to support VLAN 20 traffic between
switches, the design uses a second link between switches, with that link inside VLAN 20.
The design in Figure 8-3 functions perfectly. For example, PC11 (in VLAN 10) can send a
frame to PC14. The frame flows into SW1, over the top link (the one that is in VLAN 10)
and over to SW2.

Figure 8-3 Multiswitch VLAN Without VLAN Trunking
The design shown in Figure 8-3 works, but it simply does not scale very well. It requires one
physical link between switches to support every VLAN. If a design needed 10 or 20 VLANs,
you would need 10 or 20 links between switches, and you would use 10 or 20 switch ports
(on each switch) for those links.
VLAN Tagging Concepts
VLAN trunking creates one link between switches that supports as many VLANs as you
need. As a VLAN trunk, the switches treat the link as if it were a part of all the VLANs. At
the same time, the trunk keeps the VLAN traffic separate, so frames in VLAN 10 would not
go to devices in VLAN 20, and vice versa, because each frame is identified by VLAN number as it crosses the trunk. Figure 8-4 shows the idea, with a single physical link between the
two switches.
VLAN 20
VLAN 10
SW1 SW2 20 10 20 10 20
Figure 8-4 Multiswitch VLAN with Trunking
The use of trunking allows switches to forward frames from multiple VLANs over a single
physical connection by adding a small header to the Ethernet frame. For example, Figure
8-5 shows PC11 sending a broadcast frame on interface Fa0/1 at Step 1. To flood the frame,
switch SW1 needs to forward the broadcast frame to switch SW2. However, SW1 needs to
let SW2 know that the frame is part of VLAN 10, so that after the frame is received, SW2
will flood the frame only into VLAN 10, and not into VLAN 20. So, as shown at Step 2,
before sending the frame, SW1 adds a VLAN header to the original Ethernet frame, with the
VLAN header listing a VLAN ID of 10 in this case.

Figure 8-5 VLAN Trunking Between Two Switches
When SW2 receives the frame, it understands that the frame is in VLAN 10. SW2 then removes
the VLAN header, forwarding the original frame out its interfaces in VLAN 10 (Step 3).
For another example, consider the case when PC21 (in VLAN 20) sends a broadcast.
SW1 sends the broadcast out port Fa0/4 (because that port is in VLAN 20) and out Gi0/1
(because it is a trunk, meaning that it supports multiple different VLANs). SW1 adds a
trunking header to the frame, listing a VLAN ID of 20. SW2 strips off the trunking header
after determining that the frame is part of VLAN 20, so SW2 knows to forward the frame
out only ports Fa0/3 and Fa0/4, because they are in VLAN 20, and not out ports Fa0/1 and
Fa0/2, because they are in VLAN 10.
The 802.1Q and ISL VLAN Trunking Protocols
Cisco has supported two different trunking protocols over the years: Inter-Switch Link (ISL)
and IEEE 802.1Q. Cisco created the ISL years before 802.1Q, in part because the IEEE had
not yet defined a VLAN trunking standard. Today, 802.1Q has become the more popular
trunking protocol, with Cisco not even bothering to support ISL in many of its switch models today.
While both ISL and 802.1Q tag each frame with the VLAN ID, the details differ. 802.1Q
inserts an extra 4-byte 802.1Q VLAN header into the original frame’s Ethernet header, as
shown at the top of Figure 8-6. As for the fields in the 802.1Q header, only the 12-bit VLAN
ID field inside the 802.1Q header matters for topics discussed in this book. This 12-bit field
supports a theoretical maximum of 212 (4096) VLANs, but in practice it supports a maximum of 4094. (Both 802.1Q and ISL use 12 bits to tag the VLAN ID, with two reserved
values [0 and 4095].)
Cisco switches break the range of VLAN IDs (1–4094) into two ranges: the normal range and
the extended range. All switches can use normal-range VLANs with values from 1 to 1005.
Only some switches can use extended-range VLANs with VLAN IDs from 1006 to 4094.
The rules for which switches can use extended-range VLANs depend on the configuration
of the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP), which is discussed briefly in the section “VLAN
Trunking Configuration,” later in this chapter.

Figure 8-6 802.1Q Trunking
802.1Q also defines one special VLAN ID on each trunk as the native VLAN (defaulting to use
VLAN 1). By definition, 802.1Q simply does not add an 802.1Q header to frames in the native
VLAN. When the switch on the other side of the trunk receives a frame that does not have an
802.1Q header, the receiving switch knows that the frame is part of the native VLAN. Note that
because of this behavior, both switches must agree on which VLAN is the native VLAN.
The 802.1Q native VLAN provides some interesting functions, mainly to support connections to devices that do not understand trunking. For example, a Cisco switch could be
cabled to a switch that does not understand 802.1Q trunking. The Cisco switch could send
frames in the native VLAN—meaning that the frame has no trunking header—so that the
other switch would understand the frame. The native VLAN concept gives switches the
capability of at least passing traffic in one VLAN (the native VLAN), which can allow some
basic functions, like reachability to telnet into a switch.
Forwarding Data Between VLANs
If you create a campus LAN that contains many VLANs, you typically still need all devices
to be able to send data to all other devices. This next topic discusses some concepts about
how to route data between those VLANs.
The Need for Routing Between VLANs
LAN switches that forward data based on Layer 2 logic, as discussed so far in this book,
often go by the name Layer 2 switch. For example, Chapter 5, “Analyzing Ethernet LAN
Switching,” discussed how LAN switches receive Ethernet frames (a Layer 2 concept), look
at the destination Ethernet MAC address (a Layer 2 address), and forward the Ethernet frame
out some other interface. All those concepts are defined by Layer 2 protocols, hence the
name Layer 2 switch.
Layer 2 switches perform their logic per VLAN. For example, in Figure 8-7, the two PCs
on the left sit in VLAN 10, in subnet 10. The two PCs on the right sit in a different VLAN
(20), with a different subnet (20). Note that the figure repeats earlier Figure 8-2, but with the
switch broken into halves, to emphasize the point that Layer 2 switches will not forward data
between two VLANs.
As shown in the figure, when configured with some ports in VLAN 10 and others in VLAN
20, the switch acts like two separate switches in which it will forward traffic. In fact, one
goal of VLANs is to separate traffic in one VLAN from another, preventing frames in one
VLAN from leaking over to other VLANs. For example, when Dino (in VLAN 10) sends any
Ethernet frame, if SW1 is a Layer 2 switch, that switch will not forward the frame to the PCs
on the right in VLAN 20.

Figure 8-7 Layer 2 Switch Does Not Route Between the VLANs
Routing Packets Between VLANs with a Router
When including VLANs in a campus LAN design, the devices in a VLAN need to be in the
same subnet. Following the same design logic, devices in different VLANs need to be in different subnets.
To forward packets between VLANs, the network must use a device that acts as a router. You
can use an actual router, as well as some other switches that can perform some functions like a
router. These switches that also perform Layer 3 routing functions go by the name multilayer
switch or Layer 3 switch. This section first discusses how to forward data between VLANs
when using Layer 2 switches and ends with a brief discussion of how to use Layer 3 switches.
For example, Figure 8-8 shows a router that can route packets between subnets 10 and 20.
The figure shows the same Layer 2 switch as shown in Figure 8-7, with the same perspective
of the switch being split into parts with two different VLANs, and with the same PCs in the
same VLANs and subnets. Now Router R1 has one LAN physical interface connected to the
switch and assigned to VLAN 10, and a second physical interface connected to the switch
and assigned to VLAN 20. With an interface connected to each subnet, the Layer 2 switch
can keep doing its job—forwarding frames inside a VLAN, while the router can do its job—
routing IP packets between the subnets.

Figure 8-8 Routing Between Two VLANs on Two Physical Interfaces
The figure shows an IP packet being routed from Fred, which sits in one VLAN/subnet, to
Betty, which sits in the other. The Layer 2 switch forwards two different Layer 2 Ethernet
frames: one in VLAN 10, from Fred to R1’s F0/0 interface, and the other in VLAN 20, from
R1’s F0/1 interface to Betty. From a Layer 3 perspective, Fred sends the IP packet to its
default router (R1), and R1 routes the packet out another interface (F0/1) into another subnet
where Betty resides.
The design in Figure 8-8 works, but there are several different solutions for routing packets
between VLANs. This chapter shows the option of using a separate physical router, with a

separate link per VLAN, because it can be the easiest of the options to understand and visualize. Chapter 17, “IP Routing in the LAN,” works through those other features for routing
packets between VLANs.
VLAN and VLAN Trunking Configuration and
Verification
Cisco switches do not require any configuration to work. You can purchase Cisco switches,
install devices with the correct cabling, turn on the switches, and they work. You would
never need to configure the switch, and it would work fine, even if you interconnected
switches, until you needed more than one VLAN. But if you want to use VLANs—and most
enterprise networks do—you need to add some configuration.
This chapter separates the VLAN configuration details into two major sections. The first section looks at how to configure static access interfaces: switch interfaces configured to be in
one VLAN only, therefore not using VLAN trunking. The second part shows how to configure interfaces that do use VLAN trunking.
Creating VLANs and Assigning Access VLANs to an Interface
This section shows how to create a VLAN, give the VLAN a name, and assign interfaces to a
VLAN. To focus on these basic details, this section shows examples using a single switch, so
VLAN trunking is not needed.
For a Cisco switch to forward frames in a particular VLAN, the switch must be configured
to believe that the VLAN exists. In addition, the switch must have nontrunking interfaces
(called access interfaces, or static access interfaces) assigned to the VLAN, and/or trunks
that support the VLAN. The configuration steps for access interfaces are as follows:
Step 1. To configure a new VLAN, follow these steps:
A. From configuration mode, use the vlan vlan-id command in global configuration mode to create the VLAN and to move the user into VLAN configuration mode.
B. (Optional) Use the name name command in VLAN configuration mode
to list a name for the VLAN. If not configured, the VLAN name is
VLANZZZZ, where ZZZZ is the four-digit decimal VLAN ID.
Step 2. For each access interface, follow these steps:
A. Use the interface type number command in global configuration mode to
move into interface configuration mode for each desired interface.
B. Use the switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configuration mode to specify the VLAN number associated with that interface.
C. (Optional) Use the switchport mode access command in interface configuration mode to make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not
trunk).
While the list might look a little daunting, the process on a single switch is actually pretty
simple. For example, if you want to put the switch’s ports in three VLANs—11, 12, and
Config

13—you first add three vlan commands: vlan 11, vlan 12, and vlan 13. Then, for each interface, add a switchport access vlan 11 (or 12 or 13) command to assign that interface to the
proper VLAN.
NOTE The term default VLAN (as shown in the exam topics) refers to the default setting
on the switchport access vlan vlan-id command, and that default is VLAN ID 1. In other
words, by default, each port is assigned to access VLAN 1.
VLAN Configuration Example 1: Full VLAN Configuration
Examples 8-1, 8-2, and 8-3 work through one scenario with VLAN configuration and verification. To begin, Example 8-1 begins by showing the VLANs in switch SW1 in Figure 8-9,

of five nondeletable VLANs, with all interfaces assigned to VLAN 1. VLAN 1 cannot be

VLANs today. In particular, note that this 2960 switch has 24 Fast Ethernet ports (Fa0/1–
Fa0/24) and two Gigabit Ethernet ports (Gi0/1 and Gi0/2), all of which are listed as being in

VLAN 1 per that first command’s output, confirming that by default, Cisco switches assign
all ports to VLAN 1.
Next, Example 8-2 shows steps that mirror the VLAN configuration checklist, namely the
configuration of VLAN 2, plus the assignment of VLAN 2 as the access VLAN on two
ports: Fa0/13 and Fa0/14.

Take a moment to compare the output of the show vlan brief commands in Example 8-2
(after adding the configuration) versus Example 8-1. Example 8-2 shows new information
about VLAN 2, with ports Fa0/13 and Fa0/14 no longer being listed with VLAN 1, but now
listed as assigned to VLAN 2.
To complete this scenario, Example 8-3 shows a little more detail about the VLAN itself.
First, the show running-config command lists both the vlan 2 and switchport access vlan
2 commands as configured in Example 8-2. Also, note that earlier Example 8-2 uses the
interface range command, with one instance of the switchport access vlan 2 interface
subcommand. However, Example 8-3 shows how the switch actually applied that command
to both Fa0/13 and Fa0/14. Example 8-3 ends with the show vlan id 2 command, which
confirms the operational status that ports Fa0/13 and Fa0/14 are assigned to VLAN 2.

The example surrounding Figure 8-9 uses six switch ports, all of which need to operate as
access ports. That is, each port should not use trunking but instead should be assigned to
a single VLAN, as assigned by the switchport access vlan vlan-id command. For ports
that should always act as access ports, add the optional interface subcommand switchport
mode access. This command tells the switch to always be an access interface and disables
the protocol that negotiates trunking (Dynamic Trunking Protocol [DTP]) with the device on
the other end of the link. (The upcoming section “VLAN Trunking Configuration” discusses
more details about the commands that allow a port to negotiate whether it should use
trunking.)
NOTE The book includes a video that works through a different VLAN configuration
example as well. You can find the video on the companion website.

VLAN Configuration Example 2: Shorter VLAN Configuration
Example 8-2 shows how to configure a VLAN and add two ports to the VLAN as access
ports. Example 8-4 does the same, this time with VLAN 3, and this time with a much briefer
alternative configuration. The configuration completes the configuration of the design
shown in Figure 8-9, by adding two ports to VLAN 3.

Example 8-2 shows how a switch can dynamically create a VLAN—the equivalent of the
vlan vlan-id global config command—when the switchport access vlan interface subcommand refers to a currently unconfigured VLAN. This example begins with SW1 not knowing
about VLAN 3. With the addition of the switchport access vlan 3 interface subcommand,
the switch realized that VLAN 3 did not exist, and as noted in the shaded message in the
example, the switch created VLAN 3, using a default name (VLAN0003). The engineer did
not need to type the vlan 3 global command to create VLAN 3; the switch did that automatically. No other steps are required to create the VLAN. At the end of the process, VLAN 3
exists in the switch, and interfaces Fa0/15 and Fa0/16 are in VLAN 3, as noted in the shaded
part of the show vlan brief command output.
VLAN Trunking Protocol
Before showing more configuration examples, you also need to know something about a
Cisco protocol and tool called the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP). VTP is a Cisco proprietary
||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
ptg29743230
190    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
tool on Cisco switches that advertises each VLAN configured in one switch (with the vlan
number command) so that all the other switches in the campus learn about that VLAN.
This book does not discuss VTP as an end to itself for a few different reasons. First, the current CCNA 200-301 exam blueprint ignores VTP, as do the CCNP Enterprise Core and CCNP
Enterprise Advanced Routing blueprints. Additionally, many enterprises choose to disable VTP.
Also, you can easily disable VTP so that it has no impact on your switches in the lab, which
is exactly what I did when building all the examples in this book.
However, VTP has some small impact on how every Cisco Catalyst switch works, even if you
do not try to use VTP. This brief section introduces enough details of VTP so that you can
see these small differences in VTP that cannot be avoided.
First, all examples in this book (and in Volume 2) use switches that disable VTP in some way.
Interestingly, for much of VTP’s decades of existence, most switches did not allow VTP to
be disabled completely; on those switches, to effectively disable VTP, the engineer would set
the switch to use VTP transparent mode (with the vtp mode transparent global command).
Some switches now have an option to disable VTP completely with the vtp mode off global
command. For the purposes of this book, configuring a switch with either transparent mode
or off mode disables VTP.
Note that both transparent and off modes prevent VTP from learning and advertising about
VLAN configuration. Those modes allow a switch to configure all VLANs, including standard- and extended-range VLANs. Additionally, switches using transparent or off modes list
the vlan configuration commands in the running-config file.
Finally, on a practical note, if you happen to do lab exercises with real switches or with simulators, and you see unusual results with VLANs, check the VTP status with the show vtp
status command. If your switch uses VTP server or client mode, you will find
■ The server switches can configure VLANs in the standard range only (1–1005).
■ The client switches cannot configure VLANs.
■ Both servers and clients may be learning new VLANs from other switches and seeing
their VLANs deleted by other switches because of VTP.
■ The show running-config command does not list any vlan commands; you must use
other show commands to find out about the configured VLANs.
If possible in the lab, switch to disable VTP and ignore VTP for your switch configuration
practice until you decide to learn more about VTP for other purposes.
NOTE Do not change VTP settings on any switch that also connects to the production
network until you know how VTP works and you talk with experienced colleagues. Doing
so can cause real harm to your LAN. For example, if the switch you configure connects to
other switches, which in turn connect to switches used in the production LAN, you could
accidentally change the VLAN configuration in other switches with serious impact to the
operation of the network. You could delete VLANs and cause outages. Be careful and never
experiment with VTP settings on a switch unless it and the other switches connected to it
have absolutely no physical links connected to the production LAN.

VLAN Trunking Configuration
Trunking configuration between two Cisco switches can be very simple if you just statically
configure trunking. For example, most Cisco Catalyst switches today support only 802.1Q
and not ISL. You could literally add one interface subcommand for the switch interface on
each side of the link (switchport mode trunk), and you would create a VLAN trunk that
supported all the VLANs known to each switch.
However, trunking configuration on Cisco switches includes many more options, including
several options for dynamically negotiating various trunking settings. The configuration can
either predefine different settings or tell the switch to negotiate the settings, as follows:
■ The type of trunking: IEEE 802.1Q, ISL, or negotiate which one to use, on switches that
support both types of trunking.
■ The administrative mode: Whether to always trunk, always not trunk, or negotiate
whether to trunk or not.
First, consider the type of trunking. Cisco switches that support ISL and 802.1Q can negotiate which type to use, using the Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP). If both switches support
both protocols, they use ISL; otherwise, they use the protocol that both support. Today,
many Cisco switches do not support the older ISL trunking protocol. Switches that support
both types of trunking use the switchport trunk encapsulation {dot1q | isl | negotiate} interface subcommand to either configure the type or allow DTP to negotiate the type.
DTP can also negotiate whether the two devices on the link agree to trunk at all, as guided
by the local switch port’s administrative mode. The administrative mode refers to the configuration setting for whether trunking should be used. Each interface also has an operational
mode, which refers to what is currently happening on the interface and might have been
chosen by DTP’s negotiation with the other device. Cisco switches use the switchport mode
interface subcommand to define the administrative trunking mode, as listed in Table 8-2.
Table 8-2 Trunking Administrative Mode Options with the switchport mode Command
Command Option Description
access Always act as an access (nontrunk) port
trunk Always act as a trunk port
dynamic desirable Initiates negotiation messages and responds to negotiation messages to
dynamically choose whether to start using trunking
dynamic auto Passively waits to receive trunk negotiation messages, at which point
the switch will respond and negotiate whether to use trunking
For example, consider the two switches shown in Figure 8-10. This figure expands the design
shown earlier in Figure 8-9, with a trunk to a new switch (SW2) and with parts of VLANs 1
and 3 on ports attached to SW2. The two switches use a Gigabit Ethernet link for the trunk.
In this case, the trunk does not dynamically form by default because both (2960) switches
default to an administrative mode of dynamic auto, meaning that neither switch initiates the
trunk negotiation process. When one switch is changed to use dynamic desirable mode,
which does initiate the negotiation, the switches negotiate to use trunking, specifically
802.1Q because the 2960s support only 802.1Q.

SW1# show interfaces trunk
SW1#
First, focus on the highlighted items from the output of the show interfaces switchport
command at the beginning of Example 8-3. The output lists the default administrative mode
setting of dynamic auto. Because SW2 also defaults to dynamic auto, the command lists
SW1’s operational status as “access,” meaning that it is not trunking. (“Dynamic auto” tells
both switches to sit there and wait on the other switch to start the negotiations.) The third
shaded line points out the only supported type of trunking (802.1Q). (On a switch that supports both ISL and 802.1Q, this value would by default list “negotiate,” to mean that the type
of encapsulation is negotiated.) Finally, the operational trunking type is listed as “native,”
which is a reference to the 802.1Q native VLAN.
The end of the example shows the output of the show interfaces trunk command, but with
no output. This command lists information about all interfaces that currently operationally
trunk; that is, it lists interfaces that currently use VLAN trunking. With no interfaces listed,
this command also confirms that the link between switches is not trunking.
Next, consider Example 8-6, which shows the new configuration that enables trunking. In
this case, SW1 is configured with the switchport mode dynamic desirable command, which
asks the switch to both negotiate as well as to begin the negotiation process, rather than
waiting on the other device. The example shows that as soon as the command is issued, log
messages appear showing that the interface goes down and then back up again, which happens when the interface transitions from access mode to trunk mode.

Example 8-6 repeats the show interfaces gi0/1 switchport command seen in Example 8-5,
but after configuring VLAN trunking, so this time the output shows that SW1’s G0/1 interface now operates as a trunk. Note that the command still lists the administrative settings,
which denote the configured values along with the operational settings, which list what the
switch is currently doing. SW1 now claims to be in an operational mode of trunk, with an
operational trunking encapsulation of dot1Q.
Example 8-7 now repeats the same show interfaces trunk command that showed no output
at all back in Example 8-5. Now that SW1 trunks on its G0/1 port, the output in Example 8-7
lists G0/1, confirming that G0/1 is now operationally trunking. The next section discusses
the meaning of the output of this command. Also, note that the end of the example repeats
the show vlan id 2 command; of note, it includes the trunk port G0/1 in the output because
the trunk port can forward traffic in VLAN 2.

For the exams, you should be ready to interpret the output of the show interfaces
switchport command, realize the administrative mode implied by the output, and know
whether the link should operationally trunk based on those settings. Table 8-3 lists the
combinations of the trunking administrative modes and the expected operational mode
(trunk or access) resulting from the configured settings. The table lists the administrative
mode used on one end of the link on the left, and the administrative mode on the switch on
the other end of the link across the top of the table.

Modes

trunk Do Not Use1 Trunk Trunk Trunk

1 When two switches configure a mode of “access” on one end and “trunk” on the other, problems occur.
Avoid this combination.
Finally, before leaving the discussion of configuring trunks, Cisco recommends disabling
trunk negotiation on most ports for better security. The majority of switch ports on most
switches will be used to connect to users and configured with the command switchport
mode access—which also disables DTP. For ports without the switchport mode access
command—for instance, ports statically configured to trunk with the switchport mode
trunk command—DTP still operates, but you can disable DTP negotiations altogether using
the switchport nonegotiate interface subcommand.

Implementing Interfaces Connected to Phones
This next topic is strange, at least in the context of access links and trunk links. In the world
of IP telephony, telephones use Ethernet ports to connect to an Ethernet network so they
can use IP to send and receive voice traffic sent via IP packets. To make that work, the
switch’s Ethernet port acts like an access port, but at the same time, the port acts like a trunk
in some ways. This last topic of the chapter works through those main concepts.
Data and Voice VLAN Concepts
Before IP telephony, a PC could sit on the same desk as a phone. The phone happened to use
UTP cabling, with that phone connected to some voice device (often called a voice switch
or a private branch exchange [PBX]). The PC, of course, connected using an unshielded
twisted-pair (UTP) cable to the usual LAN switch that sat in the wiring closet—sometimes in
the same wiring closet as the voice switch. Figure 8-11 shows the idea.

Figure 8-11 Before IP Telephony: PC and Phone, One Cable Each, Connect to Two
Different Devices
The term IP telephony refers to the branch of networking in which the telephones use IP
packets to send and receive voice as represented by the bits in the data portion of the IP
packet. The phones connect to the network like most other end-user devices, using either
Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These new IP phones did not connect via cable directly to a voice switch,
instead connecting to the IP network using an Ethernet cable and an Ethernet port built
in to the phone. The phones then communicated over the IP network with software that
replaced the call setup and other functions of the PBX. (The current products from Cisco
that perform this IP telephony control function are called Cisco Unified Communication
Manager.)
The migration from using the already-installed telephone cabling to these new IP phones
that needed UTP cables that supported Ethernet caused some problems in some offices. In
particular:
■ The older non-IP phones used a category of UTP cabling that often did not support 100-
Mbps or 1000-Mbps Ethernet.
■ Most offices had a single UTP cable running from the wiring closet to each desk, but now
two devices (the PC and the new IP phone) both needed a cable from the desktop to the
wiring closet.
■ Installing a new cable to every desk would be expensive, plus you would need more
switch ports.

To solve this problem, Cisco embedded small three-port switches into each phone.
IP telephones have included a small LAN switch, on the underside of the phone, since the
earliest IP telephone products. Figure 8-12 shows the basic cabling, with the wiring closet
cable connecting to one physical port on the embedded switch, the PC connecting with a
short patch cable to the other physical port, and the phone’s internal CPU connecting to an
internal switch port.

Sites that use IP telephony, which includes almost every company today, now have two
devices off each access port. In addition, Cisco best practices for IP telephony design tell us
to put the phones in one VLAN and the PCs in a different VLAN. To make that happen, the
switch port acts a little like an access link (for the PC’s traffic), and a little like a trunk (for
the phone’s traffic). The configuration defines two VLANs on that port, as follows:
Data VLAN: Same idea and configuration as the access VLAN on an access port but
defined as the VLAN on that link for forwarding the traffic for the device connected to
the phone on the desk (typically the user’s PC).
Voice VLAN: The VLAN defined on the link for forwarding the phone’s traffic. Traffic in
this VLAN is typically tagged with an 802.1Q header.
Figure 8-13 illustrates this design with two VLANs on access ports that support IP
telephones.

Data and Voice VLAN Configuration and Verification
Configuring a switch port to support IP phones, once you know the planned voice and data
VLAN IDs, requires just a few easy commands. Making sense of the show commands once
it is configured, however, can be a challenge. The port acts like an access port in many ways.
However, with most configuration options, the voice frames flow with an 802.1Q header, so
that the link supports frames in both VLANs on the link. But that makes for some different
show command output.
Example 8-8 shows an example configuration. In this case, all four switch ports F0/1–F0/4
begin with default configuration. The configuration adds the new data and voice VLANs.
The example then configures all four ports as access ports and defines the access VLAN,
which is also called the data VLAN when discussing IP telephony. Finally, the configuration
includes the switchport voice vlan 11 command, which defines the voice VLAN used on the
port. The example matches Figure 8-13, using ports F0/1–F0/4.

NOTE CDP, which is discussed in the CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2,
Chapter 9, “Device Management Protocols,” must be enabled on an interface for a voice
access port to work with Cisco IP phones. Cisco switches and routers enable CDP by
default, so its configuration is not shown here.
The following list details the configuration steps for easier review and study:
Step 1. Use the vlan vlan-id command in global configuration mode to create the data
and voice VLANs if they do not already exist on the switch.
Step 2. Configure the data VLAN like an access VLAN, as usual:
A. Use the interface type number command global configuration mode to
move into interface configuration mode.
B. Use the switchport access vlan id-number command in interface configuration mode to define the data VLAN.
C. Use the switchport mode access command in interface configuration mode
to make this port always operate in access mode (that is, to not trunk).
Step 3. Use the switchport voice vlan id-number command in interface configuration
mode to set the voice VLAN ID.

Verifying the status of a switch port configured like Example 8-8 shows some different
output compared to the pure access port and pure trunk port configurations seen earlier in
this chapter. For example, the show interfaces switchport command shows details about
the operation of an interface, including many details about access ports. Example 8-9 shows
those details for port F0/4 after the configuration in Example 8-8 was added.
Example 8-9 Verifying the Data VLAN (Access VLAN) and Voice VLAN

Access Mode VLAN: 10 (VLAN0010)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
Voice VLAN: 11 (VLAN0011)
! The rest of the output is omitted for brevity
Working through the first three highlighted lines in the output, all those details should look
familiar for any access port. The switchport mode access configuration command statically
configures the administrative mode to be an access port, so the port of course operates as an
access port. Also, as shown in the third highlighted line, the switchport access vlan 10 configuration command defined the access mode VLAN as highlighted here.
The fourth highlighted line shows the one small new piece of information: the voice VLAN
ID, as set with the switchport voice vlan 11 command in this case. This small line of output is the only piece of information in the output that differs from the earlier access port
examples in this chapter.
These ports act more like access ports than trunk ports. In fact, the show interfaces
type number switchport command boldly proclaims, “Operational Mode: static access.”
However, one other show command reveals just a little more about the underlying operation
with 802.1Q tagging for the voice frames.
As mentioned earlier, the show interfaces trunk command—that is, the command that does
not include a specific interface in the middle of the command—lists the operational trunks
on a switch. With IP telephony ports, the ports do not show up in the list of trunks either—
providing evidence that these links are not treated as trunks. Example 8-10 shows just such
an example.
However, the show interfaces trunk command with the interface listed in the middle of the
command, as is also shown in Example 8-10, does list some additional information. Note that
in this case, the show interfaces F0/4 trunk command lists the status as not-trunking, but
with VLANs 10 and 11 allowed on the trunk. (Normally, on an access port, only the access
VLAN is listed in the “VLANs allowed on the trunk” list in the output of this command.)

Summary: IP Telephony Ports on Switches
It might seem as though this short topic about IP telephony and switch configuration
includes a lot of small twists and turns and trivia, and it does. The most important items to
remember are as follows:
■ Configure these ports like a normal access port to begin: Configure it as a static access
port and assign it an access VLAN.
■ Add one more command to define the voice VLAN (switchport voice vlan vlan-id).
■ Look for the mention of the voice VLAN ID, but no other new facts, in the output of the
show interfaces type number switchport command.
■ Look for both the voice and data (access) VLAN IDs in the output of the show interfaces
type number trunk command.
■ Do not expect to see the port listed in the list of operational trunks as listed by the show
interfaces trunk command.
Troubleshooting VLANs and VLAN Trunks
A switch’s data plane forwarding processes depend in part on VLANs and VLAN trunking.
This final section of the chapter focuses on issues related to VLANs and VLAN trunks that
could prevent LAN switching from working properly, focusing on a few items not yet discussed in the chapter. In particular, this section examines these steps an engineer can take to
avoid issues:
Step 1. Confirm that all VLANs are both defined and active.
Step 2. Check the allowed VLAN lists on both ends of each trunk to ensure that all
VLANs intended to be used are included.

Step 3. Check for incorrect trunk configuration settings that result in one switch operating as a trunk, with the neighboring switch not operating as a trunk.
Step 4. Check the native VLAN settings on both ends of the trunk to ensure the settings match.
Access VLANs Undefined or Disabled
Switches do not forward frames for VLANs that are (a) not known because the VLAN is not
configured or has not been learned with VTP or (b) the VLAN is known, but it is disabled
(shut down). This next topic summarizes the best ways to confirm that a switch knows that a
particular VLAN exists, and if it exists, determines the shutdown state of the VLAN.
First, on the issue of whether a VLAN exists on a switch, a VLAN can be defined to a
switch in two ways: using the vlan number global configuration command, or it can be
learned from another switch using VTP. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the examples in
this book assume that you are not using VTP. If you discover that a VLAN does not exist on
a switch, simply configure the VLAN as discussed earlier in the section, “Creating VLANs
and Assigning Access VLANs to an Interface.”
In addition to checking the configuration, you can check for the status of the VLAN (as well
as whether it is known to the switch) using the show vlan command. No matter the VTP
mode, this command will list all VLANs known to the switch, plus one of two VLAN state
values, depending on the current state: either active or act/lshut. The second of these states
means that the VLAN is shut down. Shutting down a VLAN disables the VLAN on that
switch only, so the switch will not forward frames in that VLAN.
Switch IOS gives you two similar configuration methods with which to disable (shutdown)
and enable (no shutdown) a VLAN. Example 8-11 shows how, first by using the global
command [no] shutdown vlan number and then using the VLAN mode subcommand [no]
shutdown. The example shows the global commands enabling and disabling VLANs 10 and
20, respectively, and using VLAN subcommands to enable and disable VLANs 30 and 40,
respectively.

NOTE The output of the show vlan brief command also lists a state of “act/unsup” for the

Mismatched Trunking Operational States
Trunking can be configured correctly so that both switches use trunking. However, trunks
can also be misconfigured, with a couple of different results: either both switches do not
trunk, or one switch trunks and the other does not. Both results cause problems.
The most common incorrect configuration—which results in both switches not trunking—is
a configuration that uses the switchport mode dynamic auto command on both switches on
the link. The word auto just makes us all want to think that the link would trunk automatically, but this command is both automatic and passive. As a result, both switches passively
wait on the other device on the link to begin negotiations. Example 8-12 highlights those
parts of the output from the show interfaces switchport command that confirm both the
configured and operational states. Note that the output lists the operational mode as “static
access” rather than “trunking.”

A different incorrect trunking configuration has an even worse result: one switch trunks,
sending tagged frames, while the neighboring switch does not trunk, so the neighboring
switch discards any frames it receives that have a VLAN tag in the header. When this combination of events happens, the interface works in that the status on each end will be up/up or
connected. Traffic in the native VLAN will actually cross the link successfully because those
frames have no VLAN tags (headers). However, traffic in all the rest of the VLANs will not
cross the link.
Figure 8-14 shows the incorrect configuration along with which side trunks and which does
not. The side that trunks (SW1 in this case) enables trunking using the command switchport
mode trunk but also disables Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) negotiations using the
switchport nonegotiate command. SW2’s configuration also helps create the problem, by
using one of the two trunking options that relies on DTP. Because SW1 has disabled DTP,
SW2’s DTP negotiations fail, and SW2 chooses to not trunk.

Figure 8-14 Mismatched Trunking Operational States
The figure shows what happens when using this incorrect configuration. At Step 1, SW1
could (for example) forward a frame in VLAN 10. However, SW2 would view any frame that
arrives with an 802.1Q header as illegal because the frame has an 802.1Q header, and SW2
treats its G0/2 port as an access port. So, SW2 discards any 802.1Q frames received on that
port.
The trunking issues shown here can be easily avoided by checking the configuration and by
checking the trunk’s operational state (mode) on both sides of the trunk. The best commands
to check trunking-related facts are show interfaces trunk and show interfaces switchport.
Just be aware that the switches do not prevent you from making these configuration
mistakes.
The Supported VLAN List on Trunks
A Cisco switch can forward traffic for all defined and active VLANs. However, a particular
VLAN trunk may not forward traffic for a defined and active VLAN for a variety of other
reasons. You should learn how to identify which VLANs a particular trunk port currently
supports and the reasons why the switch might not be forwarding frames for a VLAN on
that trunk port.
The first category in this step can be easily done using the show interfaces interface-id
trunk command, which only lists information about currently operational trunks. The best
place to begin with this command is the last section of output, which lists the VLANs whose
||||||||||||||||||||
||||||||||||||||||||
ptg29743230
204    CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1
traffic will be forwarded over the trunk. Any VLANs that make it to this final list of VLANs
in the command output meet the following criteria:
■ The VLAN has not been removed from the allowed VLAN list on the trunk (as configured with the switchport trunk allowed vlan interface subcommand).
■ The VLAN exists and is active on the local switch (as seen in the show vlan command).
■ The VLAN has not been VTP-pruned from the trunk. (Because this book attempts to
ignore VTP as much as possible, this section assumes that VTP is not used and this feature has no impact on any trunks.) The trunk is in an STP forwarding state in that VLAN
(as also seen in the show spanning-tree vlan vlan-id command).
The switchport trunk allowed vlan interface subcommand gives the network engineer a
method to administratively limit the VLANs whose traffic uses a trunk. If the engineer wants
all defined VLANs to be supported on a trunk, the engineer simply does not configure this
command. If the engineer would like to limit the trunk to support a subset of the VLANs
known to the switch, however, the engineer can add one or more switchport trunk allowed
vlan interface subcommands.
For instance, in a switch that has configured VLANs 1 through 100, but no others, by
default the switch would allow traffic in all 100 VLANs. However, the trunk interface command switchport trunk allowed vlan 1-60 would limit the trunk to forward traffic for
VLANs 1 through 60, but not the rest of the VLANs. Example 8-13 shows a sample of the
command output from the show interfaces trunk command, which confirms the first list of
VLAN IDs now lists VLANs 1–60. Without the switchport trunk allowed vlan command,
the first list would have included VLANs 1–4094.

The output of the show interfaces trunk command creates three separate lists of VLANs,
each under a separate heading. These three lists show a progression of reasons why a VLAN
is not forwarded over a trunk. Table 8-4 summarizes the headings that precede each list
and the reasons why a switch chooses to include or not include a VLAN in each list. For
instance, in Example 8-13, VLAN 60 has been shut down, and VLAN 59 happens to be in

product, named “Troubleshooting VLANs Allowed on a Trunk #1,” which works through the
three lists of VLANs in the output of the show interfaces interface-id trunk command in
more detail.
Mismatched Native VLAN on a Trunk
Unfortunately, it is possible to set the native VLAN ID to different VLANs on either end of
the trunk, using the switchport trunk native vlan vlan-id command. If the native VLANs
differ according to the two neighboring switches, the switches will cause frames sent in the
native VLAN to jump from one VLAN to the other.
For example, if switch SW1 sends a frame using native VLAN 1 on an 802.1Q trunk, SW1
does not add a VLAN header, as is normal for the native VLAN. When switch SW2 receives
the frame, noticing that no 802.1Q header exists, SW2 assumes that the frame is part of
SW2’s configured native VLAN. If SW2 has been configured to think VLAN 2 is the native
VLAN on that trunk, SW2 will try to forward the received frame into VLAN 2. (This effect
of a frame being sent in one VLAN but then being believed to be in a different VLAN is
called VLAN hopping.)

Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts

2.0 Network Access
2.4 Configure and verify (Layer 2/Layer 3) EtherChannel (LACP)
2.5 Describe the need for and basic operations of Rapid PVST+ Spanning Tree Protocol
and identify basic operations
2.5.a Root port, root bridge (primary/secondary), and other port names
2.5.b Port states (forwarding/blocking)
2.5.c PortFast benefits
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) allows Ethernet LANs to have the added benefits of installing
redundant links in a LAN, while overcoming the known problems that occur when adding
those extra links. Using redundant links in a LAN design allows the LAN to keep working
even when some links fail or even when some entire switches fail. Proper LAN design should
add enough redundancy so that no single point of failure crashes the LAN; STP allows the
design to use redundancy without causing some other problems.
Historically, the IEEE first standardized STP as part of the IEEE 802.1D standard back in
1990, with pre-standard versions working even before that time. Over time, the industry and
IEEE improved STP, with the eventual replacement of STP with an improved protocol: Rapid
Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP). The IEEE first released RSTP as amendment 802.1w and, in
2004, integrated RSTP into the 802.1D standard.
An argument could be made to ignore STP today and instead focus solely on RSTP. Most
modern networks use RSTP instead of STP. The most recent models and IOS versions of
Cisco switches default to use RSTP instead of STP. Plus, the CCNA 200-301 exam topics mention RSTP by name, but not STP. However, STP and RSTP share many of the same
mechanisms, and RSTP’s improvements can be best understood in comparison to STP. For
that reason, this chapter presents some details that apply only to STP, as a learning tool to
help you understand RSTP.
This chapter organizes the material into three sections. The first section presents some core
concepts about how both STP and RSTP discover a tree made of nodes (switches) and links
so that no loops exist in a network. The second section then takes a brief look at the area for
which STP differs the most from RSTP: in how STP reacts to changes in the network. This
chapter ends with a third major section that details RSTP, including how RSTP works much
better that STP when reacting to changes.

Foundation Topics
STP and RSTP Basics
Without some mechanism like Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) or Rapid STP (RSTP), a LAN
with redundant links would cause Ethernet frames to loop for an indefinite period of time.
With STP or RSTP enabled, some switches block ports so that these ports do not forward
frames. STP and RSTP intelligently choose which ports block, with two goals in mind:
■ All devices in a VLAN can send frames to all other devices. In other words, STP or RSTP
does not block too many ports, cutting off some parts of the LAN from other parts.
■ Frames have a short life and do not loop around the network indefinitely.
STP and RSTP strike a balance, allowing frames to be delivered to each device, without causing the problems that occur when frames loop through the network over and over again.
NOTE This first major section of the chapter explains details of both STP and RSTP, so this
section uses the term STP/RSTP to refer to these protocols together. Note that this term is
just a convenient shorthand. Later in the chapter, the text will point out differences between
STP and RSTP and begin using the terms STP and RSTP separately, referring to only the specific protocol.

Chapter 9: Spanning Tree Protocol Concepts    213
STP/RSTP prevents looping frames by adding an additional check on each interface before a
switch uses it to send or receive user traffic. That check: If the port is in STP/RSTP forwarding state in that VLAN, use it as normal; if it is in STP/RSTP blocking state, however, block
all user traffic and do not send or receive user traffic on that interface in that VLAN.
Note that these STP/RSTP states do not change the other information you already know
about switch interfaces. The interface’s state of connected/notconnect does not change. The
interface’s operational state as either an access or trunk port does not change. STP/RSTP
adds this additional state, with the blocking state basically disabling the interface.
In many ways, those last two paragraphs sum up what STP/RSTP does. However, the details
of how STP/RSTP does its work can take a fair amount of study and practice. This first major
section of the chapter begins by explaining the need for STP/RSTP and the basic ideas of what
STP/RSTP does to solve the problem of looping frames. The majority of this section then looks
at how STP/RSTP goes about choosing which switch ports to block to accomplish its goals.
The Need for Spanning Tree
STP/RSTP prevents three common problems in Ethernet LANs. All three problems occur as a
side effect of one fact: without STP/RSTP, some Ethernet frames would loop around the network for a long time (hours, days, literally forever if the LAN devices and links never failed).
Just one looping frame causes what is called a broadcast storm. Broadcast storms happen when
any kind of Ethernet frames—broadcast frames, multicast frames, or unknown-destination unicast frames—loop around a LAN indefinitely. Broadcast storms can saturate all the links with
copies of that one single frame, crowding out good frames, as well as significantly impacting
end-user device performance by making the PCs process too many broadcast frames.
To help you understand how this occurs, Figure 9-1 shows a sample network in which Bob
sends a broadcast frame. The dashed lines show how the switches forward the frame when
STP/RSTP does not exist.

NOTE Bob’s original broadcast would also be forwarded around the other direction, with
SW3 sending a copy of the original frame out its Gi0/1 port. To reduce clutter, Figure 9-1
does not show that frame.
Remember that LAN switch? That logic tells switches to flood broadcasts out all interfaces
in the same VLAN except the interface in which the frame arrived. In Figure 9-1, that means
SW3 forwards Bob’s frame to SW2, SW2 forwards the frame to SW1, SW1 forwards the
frame back to SW3, and SW3 forwards it back to SW2 again.
When broadcast storms happen, frames like the one in Figure 9-1 keep looping until something changes—someone shuts down an interface, reloads a switch, or does something else
to break the loop. Also note that the same event happens in the opposite direction. When
Bob sends the original frame, SW3 also forwards a copy to SW1, SW1 forwards it to SW2,
and so on.
The storm also causes a much more subtle problem called MAC table instability. MAC
table instability means that the switches’ MAC address tables keep changing because frames
with the same source MAC arrive on different ports. To see why, follow this example, in
which SW3 begins Figure 9-1 with a MAC table entry for Bob, at the bottom of the figure,
associated with port Fa0/13:
0200.3333.3333 Fa0/13 VLAN 1
However, now think about the switch-learning process that occurs when the looping frame
goes to SW2, then SW1, and then back into SW3’s Gi0/1 interface. SW3 thinks, “Hmm…the
source MAC address is 0200.3333.3333, and it came in my Gi0/1 interface. Update my MAC
table!” This results in the following entry on SW3, with interface Gi0/1 instead of Fa0/13:
0200.3333.3333 Gi0/1 VLAN 1
At this point, SW3 itself cannot correctly deliver frames to Bob’s MAC address. At that
instant, if a frame arrives at SW3 destined for Bob—a different frame than the looping frame
that causes the problems—SW3 incorrectly forwards the frame out Gi0/1 to SW1, creating
even more congestion.
The looping frames in a broadcast storm also cause a third problem: multiple copies of the
frame arrive at the destination. Consider a case in which Bob sends a frame to Larry but
none of the switches know Larry’s MAC address. Switches flood frames sent to unknown
destination unicast MAC addresses. When Bob sends the frame destined for Larry’s MAC
address, SW3 sends a copy to both SW1 and SW2. SW1 and SW2 also flood the frame,
causing copies of the frame to loop. SW1 also sends a copy of each frame out Fa0/11 to
Larry. As a result, Larry gets multiple copies of the frame, which may result in an application
failure, if not more pervasive networking problems.
Table 9-2 summarizes the main three classes of problems that occur when STP/RSTP is not
used in a LAN that has redundancy.
