Command Syntax Conventions
The conventions used to present command syntax in this book are the same conventions
used in the IOS Command Reference. The Command Reference describes these conventions
as follows:
¦ Boldface indicates commands and keywords that are entered literally as shown. In
actual configuration examples and output (not general command syntax), boldface
indicates commands that are manually input by the user (such as a show command).
¦ Italic indicates arguments for which you supply actual values.
