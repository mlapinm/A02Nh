Wireless communication usually involves a data exchange between two devices.
A wireless LAN goes even further; many devices can participate in sharing the medium for data exchanges.
Wireless LANs must transmit a signal over radio frequencies (RF) to move data from one device to another.
Transmitters and receivers can be fixed in consistent locations, or they can be mobile and free to move around.
This chapter explains the topologies that can be used to control access to the wireless medium and provide data exchange between devices.
