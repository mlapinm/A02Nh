and so this hour we have another story from the amazingly successful series of books called Chicken Soup for the Soul

they're different because they are collections of stories these stories are true stories true life stories written by the people who experienced them 
and these stories are meant to inspire to motivate to help other people who may be in a similar situation 
and now the story that we're going to read this hour is a little bit advanced and it involves some humor 
I hope that you find this story funny because it is the story that a mother is telling about one of her children one of her little boys who is extremely honest and instantly tells the truth about everything even though it's very embarrassing and actually quite rude to tell the truth 
so when it's your turn to read you'll be able to see the text clearly
and right now we have a beautifully quiet classroom everybody with their microphones muted and turned off thank you so much all right 
and so let's let's get started with our question this hour and I'm going to put them I have three questions 
and so you can answer one two or three if you want or you can make your own statement 
I there are no rules with practicing communication in English and so here are the questions do you know 
anyone who is too honest and direct how do you teach a child to lie essentially in quotation marks to lie when it would be rude to tell the truth and did you ever say something that embarrassed somebody in your 




and I meant to put there in your family when you were little sorry there's a typo there so I'd like to start I'm trying to start from the other end of the class and so I would like to say hello to Victoria hello Victoria are you there now your sound is very poor quality I'm sorry could you try to say that again I'm sorry we really cannot hear you at all what what I'm going to do I'm going to come back to you later and we hopefully your connection or microphone will be better we really cannot hear you at all i'm sorry i'm going to go to Mina hello it teaches Jeff nice to see you again welcome please tell the group where you are connecting from and do you see the questions that I put in the chat box yes I'm from Egypt and they can see you a question yeah and so I wanted to read the corrected question to make sure I did it correctly I'm not very good at doing two things at once did you ever say something that embarrassed someone in your family when you were little okay so that's one of the three questions going ahead with your comment meath yes please Nina go ahead when is it wrong to be honest when should you lie uh sorry I didn't get it should open sun resistant know what I'll do is I'll come back to you I'll come back to you take a look at the questions in the chat box no problem no problem Louise yes when I was tired I I didn't remember hoods I was speaking here as a as a doctor sometimes you have to lie for the patient but you had to tell it true for the family okay you have to lie to lie to the patients okay the patient but talking silly with the family so sometimes help the patients keep it your hope and you are there you in it there for arranging their hope and mm-hmm yes yes yeah whoops something like that yeah it has has a patient ever said tell me the truth and then when you told them the truth I said I don't want to hear that yes is my duty to tell the truth for the patient but sorry to have a situation to the patient to the Beijing about some situation we can doubt the family this uh oh I see this ok so his father yes ok so sorry I didn't understand you I understood the opposite so you need to tell the truth to the patient always no oh yeah my duty my juices show the truth for the patient but some situations I I can not say the truth for him Oak and send it through for the thin okay good thank you alright difficult situation good example though thank you and julissa hello how are you hi hello yes hello everyone hey what's the question Kumble a doctor so I it's okay i put them in the verbling chat box and so i can come back to you but we're talking about when is it correct to lie and how do you teach children to essentially lie because to tell the truth would be rude or it would hurt someone's feelings or yeah all right I'll come back to you gossen I'm fine thank you nice to have you in the class so what's what's your take on being honest and just sorry if you can turn up your volume a little bit please it's better now sure go ahead yeah it's the middle of the night so I'm trying to not wake up anyone else yeah right yes so I think you know being honest make people upset and you use friend and but I think you lose to me someday anyway products today they probably do something or they say something so I now I think being honest is sometimes good unless it's you have a in another angle so you can't be you shouldn't be honest because you have it something you want or some you know more than just making friendship for children i think you know you can teach them by saying to them that this is not right what that's right what why they watching you normally they watching the adults and they will learn by themselves yeah of course okay great well said well said so you're thinking being honest is pays off in the long run maybe in the short term you it may cause some problems but in the long run it always pays off to be honest I like that MJ are you there yes I'm you hello welcome where are you connecting from I'm from Germany oh good ok welcome and so what do you think of the questions the introductory questions yeah I also have my problems with being honest to Peter to up especially to friends it's always it has always been quite difficult for me to yeah to be honest to someone if I know that I'm being honest to them in that situation would hurt them yeah I know some situations like what comes to my mind almost instantly is when someone is not taking care of his hygiene for example oh okay yeah and so you don't want to tell them that they have well we say in English be 0 which is body odor or bad breath yeah okay yeah okay cool say that to someone and I was never sure um yeah I always went up my situation I always think how can I say it in a polite way you know ya later you're hinting yeah and trying to get them to realize it themselves good great example I i put the expression and i like it in english it's cruel to be kind so i want to sort of separate the idea of saying something that actually hurts someone and i think that most people know with those situations or there are other situations where it is essentially cruel to be kind where you want to say something nice but really you should be telling that person the truth to help them and so it may hurt them a little bit emotionally but it will help them in in something more important so that that's an expression that we use quite often you'll hear it in a song to Antonio welcome motown yeah are you good fine and so what do you think about those kinds of social situations and specifically the situation with children naturally being so honest yeah yeah you have a delta with 66 years are you she is a little gay six years oh yes I leave this every day okay right yes it's not matter everything I think was when he was a child and read too so yeah okay you energy if you had to explain you have to splain to them the social cause costumes I mean yeah so we often say social skills absolutely and great thank you is that hurt oh no maybe that's someone else okay um and so I'm gonna move on to amin welcome yeah how do you I'm falling oh my yeah okay i have a friend of mine he is very honest and direct and he's a bit notice in english i mean he might judge ok before yeah before he make sure or hotkey supposed to write he's a brick he's quick to judge people yeah let the progress and yeah that'd make him a big trouble or is that that the problem but i still like him okay oh and obviously you get get used to people yes that's right yeah no great excellent and good and so you know it takes all kinds and so I'd like to check with Victoria again victoria is your microphone working we we don't hear you at all Victoria Mina are you ready we're looking forward to your comment go ahead please well maybe if I have a friend who's overweight and I am he saw that she or something like this and I want to help him but I can't be so honest right and and so you avoid the subject or you kind of soften everything that you say hmm I have just made maneuvers trying to convince him and direct way but using indirect ways no no that's great to convince someone sort of indirectly okay excellent right thank you and let me see let's go to Jose Enrique welcome how are you wanting to hurt me yes please yes I'll it was where you're connecting from and what's your opinion I'm from removal I always in my case you would remember one night Kate my own and my mother not talking about the worst period of something hey I asked to when I I you know Mick Zais I going to the cutie garden or the perimeter school and nice Timothy sure about that and then my teacher she doesn't know how to explain me that when she calls to my mom on mon said didn't you never talk about these topics because he knows only four guys things like that yeah I own magnet that part oh yeah good and how did you feel uh we were you kind of embarrassed or surprised or you just said okay right right now it's funny for me because you know I was a kid but right now the president at this moment I have three two nephews nieces thing there's my never listen it's good Nick nature's our girl Jesus nephew point yeah I have two nieces and white and one nephew all they are very very honest when you know they are angry or that you're happy okay I sister with me they take everything you're not you need to be I need to be very very uh tell just when I talk about different kind of topics oh yeah yeah maybe I will repeat what you're saying p everything yeah all right thank you so much for your comments that's absolutely a perfect perfect introduction to to our story and so I'd like to bring it up on the share screen and so here we go and so I hope that people have taken the time to download the document in case the share screen is a little unclear and I'd like to go to Tiago could you please start reading the story for us where are you connecting from and some bless you okay great so would you please read our title the title of the book some key chancel tea party soon parenthood that's it yeah yeah yeah I still don't download the file where can I think yeah now some people have put the link in the chat box but then you can find with all of the teachers many many of the teachers post or upload information documents and so yeah where do you find the information about the class you'll find the link to the document okay I fog and so keen their gate and Explosives by Mimi gray nude tonight children seldom miss cope you in fact they usually repeat word for word what you shouldnt have safe alter angle alright and now again these quotations are for native speakers and so I'm hoping people understood that it's funny it's funny and just this is a French word expose expose I guess is what we say and that means like an investigation that exposes everything and shows everything and so what's what's funny about the quotation this is this is difficult yes kindergarten is is a German word so please anyone so the first first statement is is normal children seldom misquote you so that means they not very often do they say something incorrect they usually tell people what you said correctly and then yeah yeah and sometimes what they say a out of the things that we as our we shouldn't say right I mean in this particular situation shouldn't have maybe something rule or something too late direct song correct yes yes absolutely now what what you said was perfect they repeat what we should not say but it this is very specific they are going to repeat what you shouldn't have said do you understand the grammar there you did say it and they repeated it did it correctly word for word but you shouldn't have said it is yes everything you like that as mean you got it Yeah right and this was something that you shouldn't have said you did say it but it was not a good idea you should not have said it so that's what kids are great at it all ends yeah we we say something unintentionally right that's the problem and and they pick up on that yes they noticed that and they hold that was interesting i'm gonna repeat that okay great and so tiago could you please read the paragraph for us ok i just if everyone else could please keep their microphones muted I'm hearing some background noise so if everyone please could keep their microphones muted go ahead Tiago okay I've heard the FBI home extensive files on every american city by the good the bad and the ugly as the mother of machete never met a stranger five years old about to start giving dirty my concerns are much for more immediate to be perfectly honest I am burn petrified petrified you think watching and how much my son's finding kinder gating teacher is about to learn about me and mine okay now this is an important paragraph because it begins our story and i'm i'm just going to ask you to to mute your microphone just where we're i'm still looking for a lot of background noise so if everyone please could turn off their microphone and so what what is this woman saying anybody some statements yes she says that uh oh no no thori and anything that she's saying and again what I'm trying to focus on is do you understand the story and again I'm trying to help you with the humor and sarcasm and yeah yes so she says that uh you know making government they look they watch everything so all yeah what cut right if you and they the the quote she quits the bad the good the bad and the ugly feel of the movie yeah i think you know in western movie a famous movie right there is two three percent so if you are a good person bad person one day whatever you are they watching ya know that she has a child goes to the kindergarten and he is the kind of child who speaks lot you know speaking to see a ride that the teachers or the nurse or whatever they have in them I kindergarten they probably become a lot of what he says they lived and they would know probably a lot about her and she doesn't want that yeah she's they are going to find out everything about her and she's not scared she's petrified which means she is I'm just going to turn the it she's petrified so she's frozen so she's and who is she who is she comparing the FBI to the teacher no sorry but thank you so much I'll her child because she's saying well you know what I've heard that the FBI knows everything about everybody okay but my chatty five-year-old he knows everything about me and the problem is he tells everybody that so it's the combination of this little boy knows everything about her the good the bad the ugly and she knows that he's going to tell everybody about it because he's chatty he talks all the time and this is an expression in English what does it mean if you describe someone he's a never met a stranger five-year-old what what does that mean and and I do understand this is advanced but it's it's good stuff and you guys have a balance it yes now he has a five-year-old blighters yeah but what does this never met a stranger mean means yes lot of people that are friends yes exactly because he does not see people as strangers he walks up to someone he doesn't know and he starts telling them the most personal information about the family so he just doesn't think of people as being strangers alright so that's the idea that's the idea so she's terrified that she needs to send her son to kinder kinder garden we don't really pronounce the T kindergarten and she's terrified that every speaker is going to find out about her and again just if I can ask everyone to please keep their microphones muted the Google technology does not allow you to hear the sound coming from your microphone so weak we do and so yeah yeah Jose Emenike I'm sorry but you need to keep your microphone turned off for us please ok thank you and so let's go with Luis the next paragraph please ok my first three kids were a little on the quiet side apt to speak only when they were spoken to but my little my little life child Jonah good talk to a post post the teacher seems like a nice enough lady but I know my son and I can't shake the image for her escorting escorting him into the teachers lounge on day instructing him to go ahead tell the other teachers what you were just telling me about your mummy I should there at the possibility ok great and so here's here's a picture of a teacher's lounge a typical elementary school teachers lounge the place where the teachers relax all right and did we understand that now how many children does she have taken or yeah it's for I guess because she talks about her first three kids and then who's this little boy loves me yeah now but an even late in life so it seems like he is a child that she had when she was older maybe well after the other children okay so they were a little on the quiet side the first three kids but this kid Jonah he would talk to a post do you understand that expression this is a joke and it's quite funny a post meaning a poll that's made out of wood or metal right so he would have a conversation with a post and uh she is she is terrified that the teacher is going to ask the Sun to report to the other teachers what his mother was doing to him or whatever ok so I hope that I hope that people understand that it's quite a funny way to find any situation alright so let's let's move on julissa could you read this first please yes it's not like the like there's anything that you see in our family closet or family tree for that matter I'm just worried about the way it might come out of Jonah's not you know like you know like guess what we got to have cupcakes for breakfast because mom's on that line eggs milk flour and those breakfast food or you know it's the feeling you serve punch with you as mama uses it to scoop that fish out of the fish tank okay and now we're we're just let me help you out with this because I know this is difficult here are cupcakes and you know in the United States a mother who gives her children cupcakes for breakfast would be thought of as being an irresponsible parent and you know just because they're made with flour and eggs doesn't mean they're a nutritious breakfast and this is what they're talking about a ladle and so it's it's used to serve punch which is juice a drink at a party but then mum also uses it to scoop dead fish out of the fish tank okay so how are we doing and I wanted to go over juicy uh what did she mean by this and what does she mean by the the closet yeah I think juicy means you know too he or she means too much me it's like a you know a juicy food probably it's like yummy are so yes it says there is nothing yummy lady in our life nothing that other people could be interesting in nothing missing exactly so this is um secrets or gossip so in English it's very common to use the expression you know do you have any juicy gossip righteous alright close it is obvious oh okay yeah the place where you hide secret is the closet I guess yes or the family tree so a relative that's that's doing something scandalous or embarrassing alright great so it's it there's no real secret information it's just she's worried about the way it might come out of his mouth he seems to be able to say things in a way that makes them sound worse than they are like you know because you're running out of time giving your kids cupcakes for breakfast well yeah he just makes things sound extra bad all right let's move on and again people can ask questions please we have lots of time to read this so if you have any questions please share them with us Jose Enrique could you read this first please yes down that's actually meals for Jonah he see the chart told the lady at the bathroom as she was from 43rd ball torture don't you think but a little fat for that and after after the hard dose and lectures so well not making such comments polar unique to me across a crowded church hall don't worry mom I'm not going to ask you why he's so far and we get in the car my fears are not unfunded ok now I'm laughing because this is quite funny and again remember be very careful with the word fat in English I don't recommend any of you use it you know unless you're talking about food ok so it's very very offensive sorry i'm just going to mute your microphone Jose Enrique we've got to sound coming from it just if you can turn it on and off each time you speak and so what did he do so what did the boy do that embarrass her somebody jump in here this is your chance to practice your English is he said call send someone by effect yeah well and then he sort of instant sorry he innocently asked the person uh don't you think you're a little fat for that to sit on a folding chair I'll just I've got a couple pictures here so here's a folding chair this is quite luxurious and here here this might be a folding chair for somebody's really heavy or her for two people but uh he and then what did she say to him when after he said that they were at the baseball stadium at the ballpark then the mother joking that teach his children say this kind of thing but she is still worried that he broke hey honey yeah ok and so she said to him she gave him some lectures about not to make such comments ok and then what did he do at the church he said don't worry I'm not going to and to say anything whenever he said that you may ask her mom about why a person is bad at phone yeah what yeah or until they gone in the car but the problem is he hollered that so that means to yell and so he yelled it out loud across a crowded church hall so a crowded room he yelled across to her hey mom don't worry I'm not going to ask you why he's so fat and talking about the car paulien he totally embarrassed her again all right and so she is afraid for a reason okay all right let's let's move on let's move on okay and here we go alright so these are good so we're going to have to work through these they're pretty funny so gossen and here are some examples of things he says what john thinks John says them not being fun annoyed when I imagine his teacher will be hearing things like here this is for you aunt Gayle give it to mommy but she didn't like it then mom said she would kill the next person left dirty dishes in her office it's a figure of speech mommy thinks that is made out of money and daddy thinks mommy was born to wait on him but that's what mommy called demand in the truck hunter okay and so let's try and work through these and so what's the first situation where the little boy says to the teacher here as he gives her a present this is for you aunt Gayle gave it to mommy but she didn't like it yeah she looks posing your secret that she doesn't she didn't like it actually so it's not a good thing you know yeah all right now we got to work out a little bit though so the boy this must be teachers day or maybe it's the teachers birthday so the boy is giving the teacher of present just okay and he's explaining to the teacher oh this presence for you aunt Gayle gave it to my mom but my mom didn't like it so he decided to give it to you I thought he just gave it its not to prison now that's it's a present so it's much worse yeah this is called regifting something else is doing ok so when you receive something you just that you don't like you give it to someone else but it's one of those things you keep a secret all right and then just you know repeating to the teacher that the mother said that she kill and you gotta say it with a loud voice you know she kill the next person who left dirty dishes in her office how about the next one the two expressions to be made out of money and someone who was born to wait on him anybody or gossen if you want to go ahead so I think the next you know the second part of it it says mommy was born to wait meaning she actually made for him you know she should supposed to who serve me serve him yes yes right yeah the one who has to serve him and she born for that job yeah right okay so obviously that's something that the mum shouldn't have said yes I know I mean I just okay no no uh-oh no probably mum was saying that yes chana then must end giclee house right okay but but probably the mum said that ah and if you know that your father thinks I was just born to wait on him and then this first statement that I'm gonna highlight in green that's probably something dad said yes that seats yeah I'm made out of money good what's the meaning yeah what does it mean someone to be made out of money yeah yes does that if you made but they made yeah sorry no it just means that the only reason why you exist is to give money to other people and it's just like you have a limitless supply of money so uh obviously the father said something to the boy saying your mom thinks I'm made of money or when the boy asks hey Dad can I have some money what do you think I'm made of money yes okay yeah and then yeah we have all right here we saying what do you think I am sitting on intuition okay all good all right yeah I'm intuition yeah what do you think I found a treasure yeah good and then in the last one what did the little boy do in class anybody there now let's let's get yes go ahead please hello welcome thank you what is your name is it really Bow Wow no you can't click Paulo okay good fine do you understand what the little boy did before the last comment know a little bit okay all right great anyone yeah yes oh sorry but I'm asking if someone can answer the the last statement yeah okay yeah okay my mommy yeah but maybe and her mom tears or said something bad maybe yes because I wonderful way I who honk attend yes yeah and what did the little boy do maybe and it is way a repeated and yes lady reaction me enough to say so he said but that's what mommy called okay the man just what you said that was perfect but i'm just gonna repeat it so the boy used a bad word in class he called somebody a bad name and then a teacher said hey you shouldn't say that and then he said yeah but that's what mummy called the man in the truck who honked at her so okay so great this is uh this is good stuff but I say this is good stuff yeah I know humor is very difficult to understand but this is good stuff alright so let's let's keep going and Bow Wow could you please read this these ones for us okay I don't have to go the bathroom when we will stuck in a traffic jam I just used it a office cop hello yes please continue we can hear you okay once I left him dude that one if you open the bathroom door in a restaurant when my mom moms on the toilet she slammed it on your arm my mom said it was okay to eat my hotdog after we could of the park d cut lykke my mom say you are no spring chicken what does that mean okay good and just the pronunciation of link yeah i saw the end no no how is no problem asian now your pronunciation is fine just gentle few words and so all right so let's let's work through this often when children arrive at school the teacher asks them hello good morning do you have to go to the bathroom and so he says no why doesn't he have to go to the bathroom why doesn't he have to go pee public he be when he was in the car yes in in an old coffee cup okay right and then she's saying she only let him do that once but yeah all at once is enough all right and so how about the last one it's just you know sorry the second one is is very funny it makes me laugh and so obviously he opened the door on her at a restaurant when she was in the bathroom she went to close the door but it it closed on the little boy's arm and so it was obviously an accident but he makes it sound like she slams the door with force on his arm all the time okay and and what happened with number three anyone this is your chance I remember I'm here to help you so what what do you think happened in number three yeah academic the hot dog of a child and their mom said yeah it's okay you finish but they cut it the far gotta at the Catholic yeah exactly so I mean it just makes her sound irresponsible to let her child continue eating a hotdog that a cat had licked but you know to cut cut the part off is ok but and then do you know the expression a no spring chicken here it is this is a no spring chicken but I'm still kicking so what does this mean Andy and nephew and annual correct yeah it means to be old it's a nice way of saying that someone's all so what did the little boy do in this one here what did the little boy due to be asked if you can yeah I guess in this situation is old and so he says my mom says you're no spring chicken what does that mean embarrassing yes nope alright this is good stuff what means what what means is that the suspension yeah uh no spring chicken means that someone is old and it's often used for women and so he's gone up to the teacher and asked the teacher who in this case is old she's older and saying you know my mom called you said that you were no spring chicken what does that mean so she's telling he's telling the teacher that his mum called the teacher old all right yes yeah okay all right so let's keep going and we've got one more here I'm going to go to Antonio could you read this one for us please it starts with mum couldn't I you need to turn on your microphone Antonia sorry ma'am can find her running shirts because they were under that he antique pile in the laundry room giganto she gigantic pile in the laundry room everything secretary call it gigantic okay and that's just you know again typical North American mothers who leave a big pile of dirty clothing that's you know it's not what that is good alright and please continue Antonio could you finish our story with us for us please my sister te with this kindergarten t-shirt will be the same as with the three before her play her play her yes with Becky Bloodgood's and flowers from the yard pamper her at Christmas and teacher appreciation time still her beauties to the principal and Hope Bela belong here on beyond beyond hope she has her own little bubble mood at home I understand understands to take anything corner says with a grain of salt really okay great so there there's some good advanced grammar here just first of all his name is Jonah that's how we pronounce it anyways in English I think I don't a standard English pronunciation Jonah and so uh what is she going to do and and what is she hoping she is going to tutor 82 mm to do the best with the dishes yes to treat her really well right yes did you reply someone it means to gain their favored to win them over ah so the dish don't seem like a monster right exactly yeah and she wants to have the teacher on her side hmm yes okay anybody else you know participation from everybody what's a blabbermouth who's the principal principal is there the director says internet yeah the the director of the school and so she's going to talk about how wonderful the teacher is to the principal she's going to ply her and pamper her with lots of gifts and presents baked goods and fresh-cut flowers etc and she hopes beyond hope that the teacher has her own little child who is a blabbermouth which means a person who talks all the time and tells secrets all the time at home and understands to not take everything Jonas says seriously to do that's to take something with a grain of salt means not to take something seriously okay all right and so that Bishop right yeah well yeah sure toot apply and pamper means to sort of win the person over and have them make them like you and this kind of thing yeah yeah so great great job alright and so I'd like to get some comments from people and so I'm Andy do you have a knot do you have a comment about the story yeah usually we need to to choose our words but I ok there we are talking especially if we have little children or something mmhmm yeah because we know yeah that's like they can replay like that we have already Vicky I said oh yeah that's right like with the pronunciation and everything up and finish an invitation I think God has to do with with language learning as well that the kids are so good at learning one I'm going to go back to oh sorry but I'm gonna get a comment from Thiago Thiago you have a comment any kind of comment to practice your English did you enjoy the story yes yeah I think the story tells how the month traits the teacher he thinks she thinks that the teacher is know that something's about her that she don't want some secrets that's right exactly that the teacher is going to find out all right look at a point in the story the little boy has not gone to school yet but she's afraid of what will happen yeah okay yeah no good excellent great and hello Robson no well he's gone sort of a mysterious student ah Lewis a comment from you please yes it's the impressed impressment how the toilet can to observe your parents and and see for them as a guide so I think is that great responsible for the parents responsibility the responsibility because it's in this asian that's important to change the bad behaviors that the child can could be yeah and so if our people had this responsibility without children maybe our world would be better yeah many people say that you know by the time a child is seven or eight years old it's too late now I don't necessarily believe that but it's how important those early years are we have an expression they're like little sponges kids are like little sponges absorbing everything jalisa yes and what it was funny and it might be a little bit of my cousins and try he was a living life like that before we meet together and we didn't like the food for samples of my name isn't fair or something like that he said to his mom no I don't want that can I have a chicken liver it was embarrassing but we understood and now he is growing and changing yes good great excellent Jose Enrique a comment from you please it's a single that I think that's first when I start the conversation creating what Coach you know we're talking different kind of things in front of the kids because they they are talking and I especially don't know who the teachers and the store or their friends or different kind of sleep it's embarrassing for us when they know trying to talk about our sequel server but if we're kind of things which happens inside form yeah exactly yeah those things that happen at home great Dawson you know I remember the story years ago we had you know predictive they had a boy one or two years and he was he had young concord like 10 years or something so they were fighting and stuff like that to uncle so I mean he wasn't the one or one and a half or two so whatever they say to him it's bad they never say good thing to him like they say so he learned that everything is bad whatever they say you have to sweet youth and they were calling him donkey was a no its you this calling him your body's it's your body so it when he was in our house and there was an older woman she was she another late if she was in our house too and they told him oh how cute you are I said no you are cute and they said oh how good you are is a 20 so he was thinking that everything is bad even if everybody else says it worked her back you're gonna dying if she was dying to have such a kid she she was also have children were adult and she said that I peel to to have one of my children be like this nothing so that's what children too and it's that's why we love them they do things that is not necessarily logic but adorable yeah you know no great great story yeah that's good Antonio
