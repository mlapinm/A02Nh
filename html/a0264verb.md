generally stick markets sometimes supermarkets okay and is it possible for people to buy food from a small farms no not really and and so in the in the city the people usually shop at the street market of course people usually oh sorry strict Marcus or supermarkets and so now is that situation changing are more people shopping at supermarkets sorry say again please is that situation changing are more people shopping at supermarkets no I think not not really yeah not really okay that's good and is is food you know are there have new imported products become popular in your country I can

uh and then have any new imported products or foreign foods become popular in your country I don't think so like but it's becoming popular organic foods and we have non organic markets you understand yeah that's becoming popular not a particular food not a specific for talking now do you think that buying and eating organic food is healthy if it's a really organic than I of course think it's healthy but you think that maybe it's not yeah maybe sometimes people can deceive people but if you um buy it from a reliable source if I'm like a super my kids and then I think it's good for you oh how wonderful well said uh Louise yes I'm here yeah uh what do you have a comment about food I mean you're the expert actually I can say that many people confuse the turn and natural food we proceeded foot processed just because um if you realized almost every food are not run because they can from the ground and the problem is when you process the photo when you cook the food how do you cook how do you make a different and I don't know how to say texture how to make a difference mail is mail in yeah mm-hmm just yeah I'm trying to think of what we say no but this is where some companies or our
