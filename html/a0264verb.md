[Verbling Conversation Food](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcbHdztpkS8)  



I wanted to start with food
I have pasted some questions into the verbling chat box and so maybe Holly are you there yes Ali yes could 
I get you to answer one of the questions perhaps our fresh fruits and vegetables expensive

I we cannot hear you perhaps 


I'm not hungry now are you are you holding for uh mitza I 

I want to do is give everyone as much time as possible to speak about one minute each it we want to stay with the topic of food but it can be diet cooking restaurants healthy diets whatever and try to pick something that is difficult for you to say 

so that you are learning to say something new and hot
have you ever worked at a restaurant

where where does your family buy your food 
do they buy it from the supermarket or do they buy it from the street markets generally stick markets sometimes supermarkets 
so in the in the city the people usually shop at the street market
and do you buy a lot of natural whole foods or do you buy a lot of pre-made foods known natural food
what do you like to drink when you're eating maybe at a restaurant or at home
