that's when I came back home or if I was in school I will search for it and the internet exactly in google translation for also to enhance the spelling because it's a low youtube to susan to her to hear the world exactly how do we spell it so like that we can enhance our level i guess absolutely i totally agree when you can get a good translation you correct the spelling and you can hear the pronunciation that is amazing yeah uh Allah it hello uh do you have a question that you would like to answer I will bake are you a fast reader I am a stranger when I read a story like high water or

cannot find what's meaning of it do you advise any dictionary for that I mean I need dictionaries that have also grown on it sorry so uh personally I recommend translations but do you know a website where you can find translations on g Dugan ok mm-hmm but I need you how to grunt groan honesty honey I have a many problems and pronunciation it yes pronunciation saudia ah yes I I maybe other people can comment on that anybody yes as I told you before in google translation we can also hurt very well the pronunciation of any word that we tape it so it will be very great that's we use a Google translation or the two ways to how do we write a word and how do we spell work yeah and another thank you another comment cream in knots ankle oh well ok uh Kimber yeah another comment from you please I I did hear about you reading blogs etc and that you write your own blog that you write it in english yes I hope not to make a grammar mistakes but I try you know I think it's good trying oh yeah like thats are they not for one huge mm-hmm everybody makes grammar mistakes and the grammar experts argue with each other about grammar I think it's I think it's very important to focus on communication yes yeah I learn new vocabulary smart lighting yes do you have a good website that you use for translations between your native language in English I not use translators but to be I use a dictionary which is an online dictionary in Turkish and English and if it pronounces the words in British American accent and in a America manston's and this is America you understand the essence this is this is very common we're gonna get out and I watch a lot of TV shows and that really helps my pronunciation too yeah great you can you can tell I can tell mohamed mohamed mohamed sorry I'm sorry I I can't hear you uh no fun okay I do ah please go ahead with a question or comment yeah when I your English a language i understand it but i'm gonna to talk i found some problems in the preparation as words in my mind it's it's a big challenge speaking is a big challenge yeah I please continue uh do I can you give me any advice projector to make enhance and my speaker being speaking again well obviously if you want to improve your speaking you need to speak in English and if you receive some correction that's excellent but also I think if you're reading you need to find something that is written in a conversational style mmm like blogs and magazine articles that are written by English native speakers and you can read a conversation okay so thank you yeah do you have a final comment no no stinkin okay good well said no foul uh no phone yes well I have just one remark about the accent British and American accents so when I watch a movie or a serie in the british accents I don't understand very well like the American one so I thought I think that's the British action is so so so fast so i cant hear exactly all the world so I don't know if ever if everybody have this problem or no and yeah so you think that the British accent is more difficult to understand yes because we spell the words so fast they they say the words so so fast yes yeah okay well I think it depends on the accent and where the person is loves but yeah that dependent person I think yeah that's interesting uh Allah Allah yes yeah do you have a question comment ready no I i have the same problem like comedy I understand but I can talk yeah yeah well but this is what burbling is about everyone is here to practice their speaking I eat yet my my problem is I afraid to talk I am afraid to talk I don't want to make mistake so I feel like I'm afraid I don't want to yeah maybe does anyone have any advice I i think i had this problem before but so many years ago but the problem I think is that we don't have to be shy and not afraid that people have some maybe stereotypes about us even in communication skill so we should let's say talk just directly spontaneous because that is the way that we can improve our English by practicing and practicing your practices and I would like to make ya too quick well sad two quick comments I am a native English speaker from Canada and Canadian cities are full of people from other countries and their english is is bad let's say but I it never mattered to me I never cared that people had a strong accent or made mistakes we it doesn't matter to us and the second point is I think that if you focus on communication that's better don't my advice is don't focus on your English focus on communicating your ideas and understanding the other person okay thank you yeah airman yes you have some flashing little more comments okay i am reading snow and like like I have a question like which which books would you recommend someone read on it I think it's about a real loyalty royalty they are tier like kings and queens kings queens history or CIA FBI okay I am I want to learn something if I read book okay so you mean nonfiction yeah I don't like fishing and love love story yeah you you love love stories you don't i don't like yeah like love story so you like to learn something when you're reading yes Oh God and so give me an example of something that you learned recently and it is a lot revelation in your soul revelations revelations uh okay you're the relationship that you have with yourself yeah and it's about government govern all of the government okay excellent Kimber yeah some comments or questions so i don't really like reading books but I'm recently i'm reading a book I'm not actually reading I'm listening it on my iphone great called surely you're joking mr. feynman anything English and I have really hard time understanding it I for example a one-paragraph I feet over and over and again I mean I listen um you listen to you listen to it over and over yeah now do you have the combination of the audio and the written text I don't know I never checked that I should like that it's wise to um neither then listen to it I in my opinion again as a language student more than a teacher it's so important for me to have the written text and the audio pronounced realistically and that to me is the key to learning a language to understanding people and it's the best way other than speaking to improve your ability to to speak yeah i'll check that mmhmm yeah great uh mohammed yep i put some new questions in the chat box if you can see you have our question or comment which question i have put them in the chat box if you can see the burbling chat box yeah i pick on our children's book all surgeons in my country read books yeah i think children three books in my country in the last couple of fusion I have a young sister she read the rotor books some if I didn't like to read because it she read they're pretty freakin book uh yeah I can do it horror books yeah how old is she 14 yeah okay yeah so you don't like some of the books that she reads yeah yeah all right great so yeah so kids are still reading books yeah I think that's good no phone yes well I want to say just about the fees of the books here in my country in Morocco it seems like a very expensive for people here so yeah the cost of books that's not hard for books gone up yes it's really grown up because it is shitting the books are shipping shipped from another countries European countries so the cost of shipping data directly increase the Casa book here in Morocco it's normal I guess but it's really difficult for people here that have a purchase power less than a normal so yeah people who have less spending money yes I also have a remark about children who didn't spend time for reading books or newspapers or maybe articles just article so Noah days we find that a lot of children the majority I guess just spending time on internet playing games or chatting with friends also the question of chatting with friends they can can just take a look at the chat box or burbling chat build we can say that some people yeah right that was not exactly like the way that we shoot it enhance our level so not to to improve to enjoy your level and yeah and develop your English no well those are good points Allah he do you have
