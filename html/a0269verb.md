I would like to ask is do you like seafood do you like eating seafood which is fish or shellfish.
And how often do you eat seafood what do you buy and is it expensive.
Do you like seafood.
What types of seafood do you like to buy and eat.

Do you know where the sea food comes from and also is it wild seafood from the ocean or has it been farmed.
So then here we go now we're talking about farm raised fish.
