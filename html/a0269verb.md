hello everyone adverb Ling calm welcome to another English class brought to you by verbling calm burbling calm is where you can connect and practice with a native speaker instantly my name is jeff watson i am originally from vancouver british columbia canada but i am speaking to you from South America I currently live and work in the country Chile in their big capital city Santiago and so this hour we are going to be doing some reading and the focus as always the focus will be to read the article and to understand the information that is contained in the article and then to share and discuss your ideas and opinions about the information that is in the article I have I can see in the chat box that people have already downloaded the document that we are going to be reading it's called file GW 38 let's see if the chat box is working file GW 38 yes it's working great and so what I would like to do is to ask people to introduce themselves and the question I would like to ask is

hmm really I don't know okay all right and and what types of seafood do you like to buy and eat and tuna salman and I don't know their names in places okay no no that's fine so we'll actually have to have students do some googling of the other names that you know but yeah salmon tuna and other seafood sorry seems i don't know clams yeah you maybe you can put it in the maybe you can put it in the chat box for us great i'm going to move on to Ahmad Ahmad hello welcome yourself thank you very much am I mad are from Syria add about seafood it I like secretly only creature as long as doesn't

that some fish that have spikes or thorns or else but yeah okay all right great if it contains a lot of first this mics or foes I will never leave it at all but i usually like it like oxen yeah okay and do you know where the sea food comes from and also is it wild seafood from the ocean or has it been farmed i think because we I'm not living that in the post outside my country is the way away from the sea don't have that experience but most of the cases we have it from farms or kind of frozen fish is not fresh one yes okay so frozen seafood yeah which which can be very good quality so yeah all right thank you I'd like to go on to em on oil hello hello teacher please call me Jeff hello Joe so Roger so my name is the manual from Congo about seafoods yeah I like seafood and in my country we have a fish a kind of fish cause from so on so it's very tasty and good for us and now is this from the ocean or from freshwater now it's from the portion because a part of my country is just nearby the yes the Atlantic Ocean okay and and then this is being fished by local people yeah yeah the fishes are fished by local people know okay great all right thank you and I'm going to go on to a smile hello a smile how are you fine thanks Jeff thank you hello everybody I am smile from Turkey I do like seafood very much Jeff I grew up in a small fishing village my village was and I have island in the lake and okay then I was swim in the lake I was catching some crayfish and wicked with my friends we are we were boiling them in a cap and we were eating them all together but the pollution died out all the crayfish we couldn't find any crayfish now in the lake and I am living now in a big city and we I try to eat one or two times in the weeks but my wife don't like seafood she doesn't she look like okay decision alone she does not like the smell of the sea food yeah okay yeah yeah that can be strong when you're boiling it so I put in the chat box we used to boil them in a pot and the term that we use in English is that unfortunately the pollution killed off killed off the crayfish yeah that's all right and Johnny hello welcome Johnny are you there okay we we don't hear you Johnny so I'm gonna go on to Jean hello Jean hi guess i am from buster and here we really like seafood Noah days the divorce amount of seafood evolution in farms MC MC Farley's seafood why why she fotis is better but not the most quantity of food is his foolishness in a farm right right now and so what what type of seafood do you like to buy specifically all also called the dreams and call someone on a lot of people I don't remember under I don't know his names in English okay we have a lot of of kind of seafood okay no great thank you welcome and julissa hello hi nice to be in your class again hello everybody first have you here I'm jaleesa from they do and I think this is a coincidence because they last week I travel to visit my grandparents and then we went to for the first time we went to a place where they prepare shrimps and they raised the shrimps in this place so I had a chance to see some seafood animals and they raised them there that's that's the correct verb yeah to raise them yeah and just in English shrimp is irregular so we have one shrimp or two shrimp it doesn't matter what it's usually just referred to as um shrimp so you would say there are four shrimp on the plate we can use it use it as blue red chips yes well no what no ass though not not usually yeah so you saw how the shrimp were being raised yes well we couldn't see them but they are in some polls but we will try them they were very religious yes okay great excellent and then i'd like to say hello to Marie hello Marie hello are you there yes my good no that's fine thank you please yeah and yes you talk about seafood yes oh yeah do you like seafood and if so how many times a week do you buy yes I'd like seafood with a profane when his because some people prefer me to roll good mmhmm yeah that's it I don't know it's great it's okay oh sorry okay alright so you you prefer cooked seafood I think most people prefers come seafood & M and is it is it expensive yeah expensive restaurants all markets okay definitely all right great and hello phone ho hello welcome are you there okay we we don't hear you phone whole but hopefully you have your microphone working and and somebody has a Diego has asked me about the pronunciation of shrimp with the the SH are shrimp shrimp all right so great and I'd like to I think that's everybody Johnny are you there Johnny okay so we don't hear from you Johnny and so what I'd like to do is to open up the screen share and let's start reading our article this comes from Public Broadcasting Corporation website PBS and so let's let's start doing some reading and some discussing of the ideas and so here we go okay and sungho are you there we we really cannot hear you your volume is very low phone call oh ok now thank you but we cannot hear you see if you can improve your internet connection or your microphone yeah I'm sorry we really cannot hear you I'm sorry please try to improve your sound your microphone connection ok so here we go so then Diego could you please read the title and the first part of our texts yes issaquah good to really be home for restoring our oceans overfishing and ever increasing demand for seafood convened with technical Osman advances of now powered the International fishing fleet Africa same in each reading yes we have somebody reading if you feel me yes fine please go ahead Diego sorry hybrid precipitated a global marine fisheries crisis each populations mmm sorry that this house oh ok now I'm I'm moving now I would like everyone to know that you can download the you can download the file that we are going to be reading from the verb link com website if you go to the live classes page and look for file GW 38 then you will have the reading on on your okay and so uh what I'm going to do is uh go to a mod hello yeah yes could you please read this first part for us again okay an ever-increasing demand of seafood combined combined with technical advances that now power the International fishing p have pressed a priest precipitated precipitated a go a global marine fisheries clusters fish populations cant cannot cannot reproduce fast enough to keep the pace with a fishing boat okay that's great thank you and so uh to to keep pace is too to continue at the same speed maybe some other people have a good example precipitated in this context really just means caused they have caused a global marine marine fisheries crisis and i have a picture here of one of the huge fishing boats that is capable of catching just enormous quantities of of seafood and they fish the world's oceans internationally alright so thank you and so i think most people are aware of the fact that there is a fishing fisheries crisis emmanuel could you read this next portion of text for us please okay the results of a long-term study conducted by a team of marine scientists which have to conclude it that's naughty persons of the large fish species in the world oceans have been fished out in the last 50 years most the world primary fisheries are either fully exploited or the periods farming the Seas examines the problems progress and potential of the brother aquaculture industry considered by many to be one of the best hopes for making up the shortfall okay great and so we have some some terms here sorry I'm just going to move go to the document so then a shortfall is a lack of something a shortage there is not enough of something okay and so you can say that really you know we're reaching a point where 90% of the large fish species have been fished out now this does not mean that they have been driven to extinction but just that the populations can no longer be fished there are not enough large fish for people to catch it does not provide food the populations are too small okay so any other questions right so is aquaculture or see farming the answer right so let's go on to each mile could you read this paragraph flores please he's mine yes chef the hope for aquaculture fish following his became the fastest growing food production industry in the world and several approaches are being developed some of which are generating constant considerable controversy and debate too many scientists it seems the industry it is going into almost opposite directions some operation raise carnival warriors fish species of fish that require fish flesh and fish oil in their diets and others race help evos species that require mostly plant-based faith fee excellent great job just carnivorous is the is the pronunciation and herbivorous you did a great job on that one alright and so in terms of species of fish or seafood not necessarily fish that swim but shrimp for example and they either need fish flesh which is meat or oil so feed that comes from animal sources versus other species where the feed which is what we say food for for animals the feed comes from plant sources and just fish farming has become and then developed a piece ound at the end developed okay so great and now let's move on so we have the two sides the two directions that the industry is going alright Johnny are you there ok I'm going to move on to join could you read this next selection for us please yes yes I am I the second broad category also includes farms racing sunfish the filter feeding models and names that obtained of nutrient from seawater part of the intestine rate over aquaculture center around the main versions of fish that need to be caught in the UCM in order to fit carnivorous species like salmon okay great and so on could you please close the verb link calm window right right now you're in the Google hangout window but could you please close the verb link calm window or go to that window and turn off the broadcast of this classroom you have an echo happening in the background do you understand so in the verbiage oh god no no no in the verb link calm window on your web browser please go in and turn off the classroom the transmission of the classroom that will eliminate the echo that we hear in the background that's an echo that we're hearing ok so I'm going to move on g1 and and so just to cover the sum of the pronunciation and so really we're if we're talking about mollusks these are shellfish we call that so mollusks and bivalves these are just referred to as shellfish all oh sorry John I'm sorry I'm going to ask you to keep your microphone muted until you can eliminate no but please eliminate the echo in the background ok I mute because on the only window you need to keep open is the google hangout window and so uh there we go so shellfish and so great and part of the controversy controversy is that in order to farm fish that eat meat carnivorous species like salmon you need to catch there are large volumes of fish from the ocean to feed the farmed fish so that obviously has a huge impact julissa could you please go on to the next section here yes fish meal in aquaculture what are the risks involved with catching fish to feed all the fish most farm races carnivorous fish enjoy including segments and shrimp are fed formulated feed pellets comprises of grain fish meal and fish oil many marine scientists are concerned about the immense bottoms of white ocean fish fish that must be come to feed experiment animals a fact that also involves food safety issues for consumers okay great so then here we go now we're talking about farm raised fish that's a good term to use then we also just say farmed fish and as opposed to wild ocean fish which is these are wild animals in the ocean okay using fish meal which is the bodies of the fish ground up into a paste okay and so this is the controversy that we have farmed fish but they are eating huge amounts of wild ocean fish and so that has a negative calm that has a negative impact on the ocean and so I'd like to go to Marie hello Marie yes yes could you read the next paragraph with ok fish meal in a clock cultural culture case study most fish meal and fish all is manufactured manufactured from mm-hmm Land Rovers anchovies sardines carefully and some eels and some of the fisheries that target these species or consider it to be well managed many minutes but not all fish meal is source this way ok great thank you so much and we have the verb to source so this means it is collected or obtained or gathered ok so let's let's move on and I think we'll go back and review some of these ideas a little bit in a little bit a little bit later and so we have well ditch are you there what is it yes yes you need them yes we can I'm exciting because it bared my first cast now ok excellent could you could you please read this next paragraph for us well you know is I'm from Thailand oh good ok yeah I will Hawkins sorrow Lena ok Intel emotion farmers by less expensive Fishman board us from my marine life captured by locate bottom terrorists will miss Whistler whistle like that dang have ridden it along the chief fraud caching caching rich williams after an undercut mary's life and at times the Machine froggy chief wrote Appetit okay let me help you with the pronunciation here so let's go back to a produced produced produce yes trawlers these are the fishing boats that have Nets is control our little side trawlers that holds pull nets behind them vessels besos fragile fragile francham and habitats hobbiton okay and so they're talking about getting fish meal by dragging heavy Nets along the seafloor and sometimes that damages the delicate or fragile seafloor habitats perhaps the the coral or rocks or plants where the fish live okay so that that could have a negative a negative impact so we have some shrimp so shrimp are carnivores so they require fish meal or fish oil in their feed so farming shrimp has an impact okay so great thank you and I'm going to move on back to a bear noi are you there okay we we still don't hear from you and so a mod are you there yeah yes sir yum here you be the next paragraph please okay mobile there is a range of scientific opinion about exact conversion ratio but most fishers fisheries experts agree that the process of raising Salman and other carnivores species pieces consumes considerable considerable more fish protein that it produces adding more pressure on overexposure exploited exploited ocean fish populations okay great excellent job considerably considerably more Confederate and then over exploited exploited exploited perfectly yeah all right now what I'd like to do is I'd like to just stop reading here and I would like to just ask people for their personal reaction to what we've read so far and so we talked about fish farming being good being helpful but so far we have read that fish farming of species that require fish protein fish meal or fish oil have a negative impact and so you can please comment on the material that's in the article or your own personal reaction and so actually if if i can get a mod could you start please by giving interest no reaction yeah i think if it really makes sense that realizing realizing color converse fish and wasting a some some other species but i think we eat as usual we as a human eat part of the fish not all of it so if we can feed our ways of meals to this fish fishes it will be very be very fine but I i if we are catching another species to to rise this kind of food I think it's not it's not working and subdued yeah well it doesn't sound sustainable is you explain that very well Emmanuel do you have a reaction yeah so to me rezi carnivores fishes in farms is not a good option because it will be it really by doing this there will be a waste of fishes as given that never sufficient requires fishes in the means so it's not be it would be so it won't be good for for the white animals for the ocean for a few white animals Yeah right okay great and a smile do you have a reaction yes chef at to begin I learnt that the arco farming is a best solution for high fish tournament in the world but let me go further I learned that it's not a solution for the high fish demand in the world because we have to kill some fish species to fit the farming fish species and the farm species it's a not a good solution for a balance of the environment for a sustainable uh fish culture yeah or industry yeah yes no excellent Wow a fantastic job all three of you have expressed yourself using your own words that's fantastic John a reaction or comment from you yeah i am not an expert but i think that these boots auction for for the people can can eat fish in a cheaper in a cheaper way then the promise economical is cheaper than than fish while then while hunting and coaches the catcher will will fish is true that implement fish the fish eat protein flesh professional media an oil a fish and we have to do balance striction of of RC + + 22 22 million to be able to to conserve fishing in DC okay no great no you said that perfectly now just two things John it's very important to use headphones or earphones and also Diego put some information in the burbling chat box for you please look for the message uh yeah but but Diego wrote in spanish the instructions for closing the verbling window you still have the echo in the background yes but uh what you thought yes and all you can read read the information that's typed in the verbling chat box okay thank you thank you and jalisa a comment from you yes a well fierce there is a problem of increasing demand for seafood and I think one of the solution for this problem was the wants to stab the our culture no the aquaculture industry but now the problem comes with the raising of her carnivorous animals they what's the mercantilist honey yes carnivorous animals absolutely so I think maybe maybe a sufficient could be that instead of being racing have you got me one of any sequel and and we often say to avoid those words we say need meat eating or plant eating yeah maybe in the apple culture industry should focus on race race in the plant eating seafood yeah yes or maybe they could have a special phones to raise the fish that will be the food for daycare viveros one okay yeah so then they they don't need to go to the senior ring or to fetch other species if if the feeder species are plant eaters ah so they can raise the feed species by feeding them plants and then feed the fish to the salmon for example okay great excellent fantastic job everybody you're just like your English is wonderful and phone home hello how are you phone home well yeah yes very welcome welcome thank you thank you so much and and your sound is excellent please introduce yourself where are you calling from okay alcohol I'm from Vietnam this is the first time I am turning this your lecture and so wonderful I connect you mm-hmm okay no good and so it is fish farming popular in Vietnam is it common yeah fish farming is very popular in Vietnam and you know I I love thank you so much I can eat anywhere anytime mm-hmm okay okay and so it but fish you're usually eating fish or other types of seafood yes I usually eat food and some some other kinds of fish okay no great thank you welcome and I'd like to say hello to a super rock hello hello welcome please introduce yourself where where are you calling from oh yeah i'm calling from tellin ya my nickname is bored you can call me both boy yo 80 bought yeah okay both excellent and so do you eat a lot of seafood yeah I I eat a lot about seafood I like to each him yep and about 0 my favorite food is seafood yep great okay and I are gonna move on so uh we will ditch whether that are you there this is am yeah could you share with us your reaction to the article so far sorry could you share your ideas or opinions about the article p article about our topic hmm I just I just came to do to this minute I done I don't know them that's fine thank you thank you and I'll just say hello to Enrique every k hello enrique you need to turn on your microphone hello hello and we go can you hear me yes yes hello now you have an alcohol problem problem so you need to use headphones or earphones results and and or you also want some clothes the furbling running long Linda Windham I'll come back to you later later let me try alright let's continue with our reading and so I believe it's it's your turn amen well and so here we go costs sorry mmm 02 Emmanuel could you continue with our reading here Yeah Yeah Yeah right sorry to let me let me bring it up on the screen there we are okay some studies working with the aquaculture industry either that's raising converse has not increased the total volume of fish being officially targeted for producing fish meal and our products which are also used to feed swam in brackets peaks and poetry in bracket chickens yeah now swine always refers to pigs and poultry are the birds similar to chickens and so chickens and turkey for example alright so and and just could you repeat the point that the people are making their Emmanuel so sorry what could you please repeat the information that was in that paragraph yeah here photography is about the work that the aquaculture industry mmm does soegaon Alicia okay and then just specifically the information that's in that paragraph what are the Act aquaculture industry people saying and and anyone can help I just want to make sure that the that people understand the point here I think they are just yes thinking of using chickens or bit okay look big you feed the gonna vers fishes or no okay now that's now that's very possible Emma thank you but I'm sorry that's not really the information in the paragraph but thank you so much now someone someone else I'll help you and i love it when students participate and share their ideas what was the question yes jalisa the information yeah what what's the point what's the information that was communicated in that last paragraph some some scientists working with the aquaculture industry argue that raising carnivores or carnivorous fish has not increased the total volume of fish being officially targeted or harvested for producing fish meal and oil products because farmers have always used fish meal and fish oil products to feed pigs and chickens oh good so yeah I think it's clear that they argue that what we already use a fish man and all products to feed and chicken so if we use this this the same a fish meal and all your products roofied kind of ours will never affect the total that I all-consuming no good so they're saying that raising fish has not really increased the amount of of small species that are being harvested or caught okay all right so one argument for the fish producing industry okay let's let's move over move on to this here and so I think we are with a smile could you please read this paragraph horse is mine yes sir however they acknowledge that the percentage used for a co-op its is steadily growing and it current growth rate the aquaculture industry will require volumes in excess of what the oceans can sustain at the current growth rate of the industrial sector farming can 50pcs United Nations if a all reports that fish population targeted for fish oil could be deflated by 2015 okay and just the pronunciation of steadily steadily growing steadily growing okay so the situation currently might not be a huge problem but aqua farming or aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry in the world and so the United Nations maybe that's Fisheries and Oceans I'm not sure they're saying that really this will not be sustainable for more than just a few years okay great and so let's let's move on to the next one so uh Jean let's the spring of the next paragraph here this next short paragraph please okay okay and fish meal resources could be depleted depleted by the 2030 there is new evidence are in some region that bill mask fisheries which capture awesome fish for fish meal have begun to stabilize the marine food web with negative impact on manga life Marine marine marine will a bio bio mass okay thank you biomass yeah okay great and then the marine food web p could someone please explain what the marine food web is hmm join hbu yeah yeah the marine food web is the the whole food in on the ship right so the interconnection between different species okay cheap yeah and we also say in English the food chain I put that in the verbling chat box okay the food chain all right great and thank you John you you've eliminated your echo good good work yes isma Jeff vatos bio must be shitty sound yeah now this I guess what they're just talking about is they're not catching fish for meat that is edible it's just simply they want a biological mass of animals and so they they're just simply catching volumes of living things does that make sense yes well okay so just simply they want to catch two tons of living creatures it doesn't it's they're not trying to produce meat for human consumption they just want protein they just want a huge amount of living organisms to turn into feed okay and so julissa could you read this next a paragraph for us please yes there are also food safety issues increasing levels of ocean pollution having an to contaminate different types of seafood like tuna and swordfish with dangerous levels of mercury okay great and just the W in sword is silent we do not pronounce the W sword sword fish okay and people are were familiar with mercury okay it's a metal that is liquid at room temperature right say and just the people could keep their microphones muted please we're getting some background noise and I hope that I have some pictures here so this is a tuna and unfortunately they're showing an accumulation of mercury mercury is one of the toxins a toxic metal that accumulates over time the levels continue to build up and build up over time especially in these large animals that's a swordfish and could you read this please julissa okay pollution has also resulted in the contamination of fish meal and fish oil with PCBs and dioxins which are known to cause cancer these toxins tend to bioaccumulate add more dangerous levels in the fatty tissues of fish that I hide that are higher on the marine food chain fish that if other carnivorous fish okay great and here's a photograph of some salmon okay and so right now you can investigate some of these things individually but PCBs and dioxins I know are one source is the pulp and paper industry I know that that has been an issue in Canada the factories that produce paper are releasing these some of these dioxins and PCBs into the water all right and so I'd like to go on to a phone hole could you please read this paragraph for us fo mole are you there yeah I'm sorry sir I can't see the the Attic oh ok I'm sorry you can download the article from the darling calm website yes ok it's called file GW 38c see if you can and do that and I'll move on to both ppl yes I put the name of the file in the verbling chat box yeah ok let me go let me see Bert Bert wing com website live classes page and the information for this class and and thank you I'm going to move on to vote could you read this paragraph for us oh yeah are you there yeah right yeah the results of the comprehensive sampling of the farm and will someone products in supermarkets across the united states and europe has shown a much higher concentration of PCBs and diodes in in from someone this is party partly because why someone naturally four inch on the variety of marine life over a large area much of wish it slower on the marion fortune okay great hi mr. i want to read this paragraph okay i will come to you later sir thank you I need no no I I will I will come to you later sir thank you and and so I just the the idea with this is there showing higher levels of these toxins in the farmed fish alright and so really where we're out of time and so what what I'll have to do is end underclass there I'm sorry to everyone who is joining the class later and just if I can finish the class and I'll just talk to the students who have joined so we are we are ending this class now but thank you so much to the students who have participated and I hope that you found in love with relation anymore please good thank you very much mr. yeah yeah thank you and I'm sorry to the other students and so um hello uh sorry uh huh are you there thanks mister yes yeah so please welcome and and I hope that you can join one of my other classes in the future yes yes thanks i'll be teaching in an hour nice to meet you ah yeah great and one save us young are you there one said I scan are you there so you need to learn how to turn on and off your microphone to mute and turn on your microphone on the google hangout screen there is an image or icon of the microphone it's activism microphone for John now mr. is it is yeah so we executive we don't hear you fun Sebastian I'm sorry okay and so all the best to you uh good luck we're joining the next class hi Leticia goodbye thank you to let you go thank you thank you smile Liz are you there ok I'm going to end the class thank you everyone thank you
