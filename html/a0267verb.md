[Materials!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjBVUJCjkfk)  

We are going to be reading and listening this hour to do two articles that i found on the British Broadcasting Corporation's website the famous BBC. 
I have prepared a document with those materials and they I'm sorry they are in the verbling chat box this is there is a link the box.com link will give you direct access to the document. 
If you open up the document on your computer you will be able to clearly read the text you will be able to copy and paste words that you don't know into an online translator or into an online dictionary to find words other English words that have a similar meaning. 
This hour we are going to talk about saving the environment to limit global warming or climate change and so we are going to be discussing concepts of protecting the environment protecting the planet protecting the earth. What I would like to do is to ask people please we are going to be offering or we have started offering paid courses with verbling.

I'm very excited about this opportunity to create my own classes these are paid courses but I'm excited about offering courses and classes to students so if you have any ideas about classes or courses that you would like to participate in you are welcome to come to my facebook page and to post your ideas about the topics that you would like to learn about the materials that you would like to use during the course and how I can help you to improve your English so please share your ideas with me.


Now what I would like to do is to bring up on the share screen the the document that we are going to be using.
