it and just as I can just ask everyone to please keep their microphones muted if you're not speaking so we can eliminate some of the background noise some of the noise is coming from me all right excellent now the burbling chat box is not working and so if people can ordinarily we do not use this but we could use the hangout chat box because the verbling chat box is not working so if you know how to turn on yeah excellent let's use the group chat box the google group chat box and ass excellent everybody's putting their expressions in there uh and yeah okay excellent so uh let's let's get going with some of my ideas and I think we've said hello to everyone so I'm going to bring up my my document and put on the screen share and then I it's one hundred percent important that the students participate in this class as much as possible so please don't hesitate to give me some ideas as to what you want to share today and so Boris could you read just the title there and some of the expressions that people have just shared the first expression i'm going to ditch oh no you all get y'all got you little bit of but please go ahead and read that yeah you have got to do what you have you kept go to boost excellent okay yes please continue worse okay I'm good egg a little bird told me rather you say what's new what's up and that's kind of my best translation for you and it's it's not very good but yeah that's kind of hey what do you say hey what do you say but you have to say okay hey what they say uh-uh and it's what do you say but we say it so quickly hey what do you say hey gussy ok ok excellent good practice all right and then we've got uh oh I don't know no just sorry scroll down and uh let's get the next person sorry ah Diane could you read the next ones please ok Oh what do you say what's new what's up to icon someone and I foreign I pay for that I don't you speak one dozen words yeah actually we usually say a picture speaks a thousand words I didn't write that correctly and so I'm going to move down to our first idea which is where are we here ah here it is so this is the expression that you were talking about and so could you read these for us please Diane yes go ahead please read these expressions please ok ok the early bird gets the worm you snooze you lose you got caught sleeping better luck next time first come first serve the third start ok now who has some ideas now the early bird gets the worm so do do people understand that idea ok please let me know if you understand it or not and then how about the other expressions and just and gas people to to keep their microphones muted and you just turn on your microphone and say hello Jeff and I'll acknowledge you because i'm really looking for lots of participation please can I yes go I think that area I think that the first expression means that the the first person that do something I get the benefits they get for for fast the the result the result sure okay so the first one there the the earliest gets the result okay now how about you snooze you lose as anybody can anybody put that now what I would like is for students to try and use some of these expressions or give a similar expression in your language or to explain it in your own words what is to snooze no idea oh yeah ok everybody else i know i am not sure it when you're beautiful call no but thank you thank you sorry snoozing is sleeping Auggie to snooze and actually on your alarm clock your electric alarm clock there's usually a snooze button which gives you five more minutes to sleep so snoozing is sleeping so then now do you understand the expression yeah that'll to be way copying lights yeah yeah right you gotta stay awake and so if you are sleeping you will lose you will lose out on the opportunity and and so sorry I absolutely love this expression I use it all the time and so if someone misses an opportunity you say well you snooze you lose yeah it's a similar expression in Spanish that is al que se lo mejor la jolla current ok now i know that one so about what happens to them they go down the river or anita in italy the same we have another expression that mean that a who sleep oops it doesn't catch the fishes okay the sleeping fisherman doesn't catch the fish or something yeah yes all right great okay and how about well so hey sorry you got caught sleeping so that means the opportunity came and went it's gone you got caught sleeping and to catch something catch someone the opportunity came suddenly and you were sleeping and you missed it better luck next time do you understand that context yep okay better luck next time and then huh yeah yo again my hot sec yeah okay and actually I'm going to put that on there because i love that i don't use hard luck that often personally but i always say to people well tough luck and tough means hard so you say sorry tough luck you lost you miss the opportunity to bad life isn't fair okay so and you say too bad too bad oh well tough luck all right and then first come first serve maybe at a restaurant you understand in Titus yes go ahead have the first gift it shouldn't surf it first right okay so first come first served so when there's no more left first and fittest out yeah okay oh ok now that that might be a little bit different but yeah that's good I like that expression and again if you can keep your microphones turned off as much as possible okay thank you so much let's let's move on to the next idea and I've tried to add photographs because pictures say a thousand words to say a thousand words what's what's my next idea this idea why under the bridge so something that has come and gone and so let's let's read these ones here so let me see sorry who's next honey could you read these ones please yes water under the bridge that's shitty as salad sorry too late better luck next time okay and this to somebody do we understand those could somebody try and use it in a sentence and then do you have something similar and can I speak yes of course thank you please thanks for example in an egg's now when we add a to when we are not in time yeah when we get answers to the exam and the teacher won't it will not accept us in the class so they would say to us auto end of the vent okay now not not quite but thank you so much and you know these kinds of things are almost impossible I'm going to put something here it's not it's from the last I'm trying to get down some of your ideas we also have something called spilt milk and so sorry but because the expression is to cry over can someone else share their idea while I'm typing to cry over spilt milk eskimo joe donnelly chiama yeah okay that's exactly what it is so what it what are you what are some stuffy nose yeah when somebody loses it a chance right here yeah he cry over spilt milk yeah so what's the idea behind spilt milk or water under the bridge or a ship that has sailed Oh tis the same meaning yeah this is the same idea like what we're talking about spilt milk the milk is on the ground you know the water has already gone under the bridge and I yes I think that it means that something is in the past and now no it's no longer important well it's gone yeah and so yeah and so it's impossible to get back yeah so water under the bridge that's gone that's history and and so yes your true it can mean not important but that ship has sailed so stop talking about your lost opportunities because they are gone forever okay don't cry over spilt milk better luck next time concentrate on next time yeah excellent okay and so any expressions that you have of something that's gone forever okay all right so that opportunity came and went so yeah let's move on now I just want to share this one idea and and again how they could you please keep your microphone muted for us just we're getting some noise coming from from your microphone and so I'm just going to bring it down to this expression early well this is a saying and actually a famous quote I think early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise so do you understand could could someone put that expression in their own words though and again I'm looking for everybody to participate just one or two sentences quickly anyone somebody yeah really okay so if you go to bed early and if you get up in the morning early every day you will baby healthy yeah you will be healthy you will be wealthy and you will be wise you will be smart intelligent experience etc one of those old sayings ok so don't stay up late don't sleep in alright so let me go on to the next one and AH do you recognize this expression can anybody guess the expression time flies ok awesome and go yeah ok right and so who's next uh handy could you read these ones please ok sure time waits for no one time's running out we are running out of time the clock is ticking time is money we are working against the clock time time flies time is one hour side time came on our side yeah good ok and then against against a gang in his flock all right now all of what about now time is on our side is different that has a little different meaning but what's the idea behind all of the first expressions ok so sorry uh uh huh yes it's me don't late or let's say I will do that later haha good ok so don't be late and don't I'm going to put the word procrastinate that's to do something later Diane you had a comment yeah you're an expression is a tiempo Soto the time is good time is gold all right yeah yeah and and how about working at against the clock when he's too late and well thank you so much not quite not quite because you would say oh that's it we're finished it's it's too late so these these expressions don't mean it's too late but what are they telling you to do essentially something you are going in the opposite way well sorry no I don't think so when you have a little time right for doing the for doing something that is is necessary to finish yes and so what are you telling the people to do we be hurry because we are working against the clock yeah fantastic good so hurry up go faster you know time waits for no one and exactly what did you don't put things off till tomorrow we're running out of time hurry up time's running out the clock is ticking tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock hurry hurry hurry time is money time is valuable yeah all right it's stressful enough for sentences yeah yeah no but yeah good yeah you're telling people to hurry up and we're working against the clock so well then so then what does time is on our side mean when you are just on time sorry thank you so much but and you know I love you all but I if if your idea isn't right in terms of my opinion I'm going to help you so sorry thank you so much but no not quite time is on our side what does that mean and we have enough time to just go yes okay now and even more than that because you could say oh we got lots time everybody relax we've got lots of time let's let's do things carefully but time is on our side and maybe a negotiating situation okay so we're not have I gotcha yes when what is the advantage though I'll having good luck ah sorry it's not really about having good luck what's our advantage chance we'll have chances sorry oh we happen to have time well we have enough time but the idea is time is working for us so the longer we wait the better it is for us okay he understand I mean can you think of an example of when time is on your side you know if if if you're you're competing against someone and every day they wait they end up losing more and more money and so you can sit back and wait because time is working for you time is on your side but longer the process takes the better it is for you okay I guess that's the idea all right it's it's nice to have time working for you or when time is on your side as opposed to when when the clock is working against you alright and to procrastinate that's a good word many people don't do things they delay them to the next day and and that's wasting time all right so here's the deep end so I I think English students should just start learning English this way so who do we have it's Mahad could you read these expressions please about water they have different meanings but they're above water okay jump in the deep end and the start swimmin okay great and keep our heads above water to feel like a fish out of water this the authors okay great and so these have different ideas so first of all and I'm just going to go back to my opinion about people learning English so in my opinion if you're learning a language you should just jump in the deep end and start swimming so what do I mean be brave be brave yeah and and so what do I mean if it's learning a language what what what should you do to start again well not necessarily to start again because you may be starting for the first time ooh I lying to dry yes take the first step yeah to take the first step good and and just do something big right away don't start with little tiny baby steps just jump in the deep end of the pool and start swimming right so so in a if you're learning English or if you're learning Chinese or whatever just go and start talking to somebody just try and communicate just right away don't wait don't do grammar exercises first just jump in the deep end and start talking to people all right and then just somebody trying to keep their head above water what are they trying to do to keep us alive yes they're trying to stay alive they're trying to survive so that's used in business situations where a business is not doing well they're just trying to keep their heads above water okay and then to feel like a fish out of water that is when is something doing very well oh sorry no thank you again Michael the opposite of that well okay but go ahead and share your idea if you feel like a fish out of the water too oh you are doing that but you are not able to do that correctly because you are now too I don't know where ya know great idea no that's okay yes it's like a when you feel very comfortable when you do something absolutely but and then it's the opposite so ya think of a schoolteacher that goes into a business meeting I think of a firefighter who is in a political meeting these people don't belong so they are very comfortable in their own environment but if they end up in a different environment they feel like a fish out of water do you understand so yeah okay so people someone in a different environment and they feel very very strange they feel lost and then to test the waters just means to try an idea first to see if it's going to work before you get into the water and start swimming you kind of test the waters first to see if it's safe to see if it's going to work all right great and any ideas from your languages any expressions to just barely survived jumping in the deep end feeling like a fish out of water the first and then English funny chiz like that's out of Athena oh oh okay and so does that mean to jump in yeah yeah being in the gym equal yeah okay yeah great just jump in the water okay good I'm going to move on and so the next idea is aa kind of the end getting close to the end of something and success I guess and so let's go to my new go ahead please okay to sprint to the finish we're in the final stretch yeah yes to be in the home stretch I can hear the crowd cheering to see light at the end of the tunnel we're going close to the finish line okay and so the sprint to the finish do you understand that yeah accelerated speed accelerate good go faster because we're right near the finish line so let's go full speed until we finish the project to be in the final stretch or to be in the home stretch someone is have sentences to aim encourage someone yes absolutely so you're encouraging people to go because you're in the last part of the race the final stretch or the home stretch is the very last part of the race and you know the expression to see the light at the end of the tunnel do you guys use that in your language today folks yeah and it has to do with hope yeah we see light at the end of the tunnel we see the end of the journey any any other ideas and any any expressions from from your language you know and what kinds of symbols do you use you know tunnels or do you use sports ok so I'm going to move on but to be in the home stretch the final part let's sprint to the finish ok so now now we're talking about sports and I use a lot of expressions from boxing I use a lot of these expressions and so let's see if we are with sorry man well go ahead okay I can't see the screen now yes or no nah okay good not to have someone someone the diana is making noise and i can't be there the screen oh i can't you see though yeah to have someone oh okay hmm okay I can't see you can see they're very scream but it's okay to everyone in your I can't no no it's fine let's try Patricia do you see the screen yes yeah go ahead please sorry manuel-logan some one in your government he can be loaded the belt at cheap is shot to be on the robbers radim ropes no to be on the ropes don't pull your Puccini Thank by the Bell who wrote in the world okay now i could use these expressions all the time and so did would somebody like to explain any of those expressions Oh Joe have someone in your common yes is it to have someone by your side absolutely someone as supporting you and helping you and and you said that perfectly to have someone on your side yeah to have someone in your corner excellent somewhat someone else please dump all your conscience yeah it's not quite as those want is yet though ok but so what does it mean sorry ah that you don't have to get it give it up ah sorry oh oh I see don't give up you mean don't get give up oh no no no oh that's a good one to hang up your gloves means to stop it means to give up fighting so no it's something different ok I'll write that one down but uh someone else please yeah yeah good yeah sorry i don't see please someone go ok hitting below the belt yes doing Gilligan would right so using illegal tactics strategies and and you're literally punching the person below their belt below their hips so that is illegal and now that's very similar to a cheap shot yes it's like a 30 game yeah ok like dirty dirty tactics yeah and and like a dirty trick but it's an illegal offensive move like an illegal punch yeah so using illegal tactics and where are we ok another idea another expression to throw in the towel yeah sorry Hamdi to be in the ropes to be in the right way Sorry Sorry thank you so much but to be on the ropes means something different Boris are you there I haven't heard yet you in a while and you helped over this well I was hoping yeah yeah please participate well the Nexus shape save it by the Bell yeah Saved by the Bell ish is like the the sitcom harem let me load the sitcom okay maybe so what does it mean when you you don't last you'll realize realize it's something of time but the time have you I don't know no no thank you for us sorry it's it's that's not the way I use it anyways well let me help ok so to have someone in your corner was explained perfectly hitting below the belt and a cheap shot yeah I think you understand that right the beat on the ropes means you're almost going to fall down you're almost going to fail you're almost going to lose so you are hanging on the ropes that are on the ring to keep you up all right so you're putting them on my cover yeah on the ropes again please for a for example and my career is on the ropes yes and so you're almost going to lose your career right how are you yeah ok excellent ok Eskimos on internet let's pileup at it no I don't think so because that's kind of in between a rock and a hard place oh yeah I don't know the Spanish expansion expressions really well but because actually I don't focus on trying to learn expressions because they're too hard but these are some of the ones I use don't pull your punches to pull your punches means not to punch with full strength so if you're in a competitive situation and you need to win you need to punch as hard as you can so pulling your punches means to know try to hit the other person as hard as you can oh you understand yes other than the problem what kind of problem you can yeah you're you're in a in a competition where you need to win so if you tell someone listen stop addition line yet although I don't know well yeah okay but then in business let's say business or you know a legal battle any kind of competitive situation where you need to win the person is telling you you need to fight with all your strength don't pull your punches means to punch the other person as hard as you can okay okay yeah right now if you're on the ropes you can be saved by the bell because the bell rings at the end of the round and so saved by the bell means that you almost lost your almost losing but then the bell rings and so you get a chance to rest you understand uh teacher can I ask you some guess please thought for your passion and your conscience is it the like in business when we say don't receive all your thoughts ah now that's a great expression not really because revealing your cards is to show your cards and that's to show the competition your your information so that's to keep your private information to yourself to keep it private pulling your punches means to go into a fight and try and hit the opposition as hard as you can okay and and Saved by the Bell do you understand you almost lost but the bell rings and so huh you get one minute to rest and recuperate okay to throw in the towel means to give up to stop fighting to give up that's it to throw in the towel and to hang up your gloves means to retire it means to stop permanently okay all right so Wow let's keep moving and let's see I'll share some of the ones we're talking about basketball and so I use some of these so I'm going to go through them quickly we say nothing but net that was a slam dunk swish is the sound of the ball going through the net a two points for me or a three-pointer and so all of those expressions come from basketball and it all means a really big success a perfect success so you can do some research on that let's let me go to another one here and where are we ah baseball there's lots of expressions with baseball and sorry we're running out of time so what I'm going to do is I'm going to move down here obviously I had more than enough oh and yeah oh let's let's look at you you play when you play with fire you're going to get burned what does that mean someone yes oh do you so then in a situation in your own words what does that mean hmm when you're well if you could just train another and that your situational good um you can't find something done is there is no support for your self okay good yeah all right is that look yeah go ahead sorry Salma it's like the Italian business they always say to not involve in the Italian business ah okay alright yeah ok about companies yeah okay and so if you choose to do something dangerous you're going to suffer the consequences okay great and then we've got a whole bunch yeah sorry go ahead maybe I don't involve yourself in a bed the things yeah sure okay and someone else had a comment ok sorry I thought there was someone else and now let me see does does anybody we're just down to five minutes left so does anybody recognize one of these expressions and just turn on your mic and say hi Jeff and there is Earth's default sentence yes he's like you need you if you have I don't know closely yeah you have a model a harmonica see volcanoes Malaka is minus the speaker's here no well that's kind of fungus play can you blame me okay but hold on you because when you have the same expression so you need to practice your English yeah okay buddy what does expression depression means a if you have a an opportunity a sexual opportunity you don't please don't you you should you how much I approached our to take advantage as a quick to take it your issue to take advantage of the opportunity oh ok well no but Boris maybe not though I'm not sure we have some other people and one hand go yes yes I know this first one beggars come on I just be choosers okay great go ahead with that one is it like you must depend on yourself you must not always depend on other people to turn those sorry sorry sir no thank you thank you so much about sorry no okay no better when you keep laughing and you don't take all the opportunity that you have is better to give someone or Sara um okay no I can tell you're doing great let me try you have something for sure you have it but you see an opportunity and so the expression is telling you not to take the opportunity not to give up what you've got in your hands to take the opportunity and and so actually I don't necessarily agree with the expression it's saying don't give up what you have to try for an opportunity and I think that's what it is and and beggars can't be choosers is beggars is a is a negative word but it's people who are asking for things so if someone gives you something don't complain about it just take it because to be choosy or picky means oh this isn't good enough okay so if you're given something don't complain about it yeah absence makes the heart grow fonder how about that one anybody what absence makes the heart grow fonder is it like a distance okay why said what okay let me try and explain so we have a couple to people and they're in love and if they're separated for a period of time they feel more in love with each other they want to see each other more and so when you're absent you're not there and so it makes your love stronger yeah um like I mean MSF Hospital do this oh maybe not no because yeah it's if if someone's in a relationship with their husband or wife and the husband or wife goes away on a business trip for two weeks you you feel the need for that other person it makes you think of the more it makes you want a more yeah okay that is something
