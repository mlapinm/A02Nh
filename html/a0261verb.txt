Sayings
(hard)

Hello everyone connected to verbling. 
Ðœy name is jeff watson please join me this hour. 
I am going to share with you some of the sayings and expressions that i use in english. 
And I'm hoping that you will share some of your sayings and expressions with me. 
And I will help you to communicate those ideas in English. 
Alright so I'm hoping that this hours class will be fun 
and we will be able to share some ideas and share some some of our culture and personality by sharing the sayings and expressions that we use 
And just to let you know that idioms is not a common word. 
We don't really use the word idioms that's an English teacher word so we're talking about sayings and expressions and there are millions of them. 
Now I am going to try and show you some of my favorite expressions. 
But I'm also going to help you to use them correctly and to use them safely because some of the expressions can lead to communication problems let's say that. 
And to ask them if they have a favorite expression in English that they use or if they have a favorite expression in their language that they use.
how are you boy
you've gotta do what you gotta do
it's a bad habit
the early bird gets the worm
you can close your eyes for things you don't want to see
hang up your gloves
absence makes the heart grow fonder
