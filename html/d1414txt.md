So evaluating the model we want to evaluate the model. We can evaluate evaluate it now on the test images and test labels. We're obviously gonna get the same thing because the valuation is test images and test labels so we should get the same accuracy as 67 3/5 which we do right here. 


All right so there we go we get about 70%. Of you guys train this on 10 epochs you should get close to 70 I'm a little bit lower just because I didn't want to go that high and that is now the model. I mean we can use this if we want we can use predict. We could pass in some image and we could see the prediction for it. I'm not going to do that just because we've already talked about that enough.

And I want to get into some of the so evaluating the model. We want to evaluate the model. We can cooler stuff when we're working with smaller data sets. So the basic idea here is this is actually a pretty small data set. Right we use about 60,000 images and if you think about the amount of different patterns we need to pick up to classify. 

You know things like horses versus trucks that's a pretty difficult task to do which means that we need a lot of data. And in fact some of the best convolutional neural networks that are out there are trained on millions of pieces of you know sample information or data. So obviously we don't have that kind of data so how can we work with you know a few images maybe like a few thousand images and still get a decent model. Well the thing is you can't unless we use some of the techniques and other to show you so working with small data sets.
