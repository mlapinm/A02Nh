Hello English students welcome to another opportunity provided by the best website in the world for learning a second language.
verbling.com is offering you free English classes 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 
How amazing is that verbling.com is changing the world one English student at a time.
I am very happy to be part of the verbling.com English teaching team by name is Jeff Watson. 
I come from Vancouver Canada.
This hour I have a different idea for this lesson we are going to be watching short videos from YouTube.
It's very important keep your microphone turned off so that our classroom is quiet.

This class we are going to be using the YouTube application so by clicking on this you should be able to watch the videos that i have found for us but also i am going to be posting the links to the videos in the chat box.

I hope that I will be able to stop the video and ask people questions.
