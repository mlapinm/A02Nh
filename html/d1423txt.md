### Reinforcement Learning With Q-Learning

Hello everyone and welcome to the next module in this course on reinforcement learning so what we're gonna be doing in this module is talking about another technique in machine learning called reinforcement learning now if you remember at the very beginning of this course. Which I know for you guys is probably at like six hours ago at this point we did briefly discuss what reinforcement learning was now I'll go through a recap here just to make sure everyone's clear on it but essentially reinforcement learning is kind of the strategy. 

And machine learning where rather than feeding a ton of data and a ton of examples to our model we let the model or in this case we're gonna call it agent actually come up with these examples itself. 

And we do this by letting an agent explore an environment now essentially the concept here is just like humans the way that we learned to do something say like play a game is by actually doing it we get put in the environment we try to do it. And then you know we'll make mistakes we'll encounter different things we'll see what goes correctly and based on those experiences we learn and we figure out the correct things to do a very basic example is you know say we play a game. 

And when we go left we fell off a cliff or something right next time we play that game and we get to that point we're probably not going to go left because we're gonna remember the fact that that was bad and hence learned from our mistakes.
