So, if something is “grammatical,” it means it follows the rules of a language.|Итак, если что-то «грамматическое», это означает, что оно следует правилам языка.
If something is “not grammatical,” it means it does not follow the rules of a language in terms of sentence structure.|Если что-то «не грамматически», это означает, что оно не следует правилам языка с точки зрения структуры предложения.

Meaning, the sentence may not follow the rules of the language but we can still communicate effectively.|Это означает, что предложение может не соответствовать правилам языка, но мы все равно можем эффективно общаться.
