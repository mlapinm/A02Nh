I will certainly try 
what can I do for you 
well, it's my first day here in Sydney 
and I would like some advice on the local tourist spots 
we offer a wide range of tours 
have a look at these leaflets and see if there's anything you like
what's the wildlife part like 
oh, it's very good 
if you don't have time to go and see the wildlife 
in its natural habitats, you should try it 
what animals do they have their 
let's see now
they have kangaroos, koalas and possums
wombats and emus
there's a lot 
I like wildlife so that's one place that I should visit 
the leaflet says that that place is a Koala Sanctuary, too 
yes, the New South Wales has a lot of bush fires in the summer 
yes I remember reading about one in the newspaper not very long ago 
a lot of koalas are made homeless when the forest is burned down 
the sanctuary rehomed them 
well it's nice to know that the money goes to a good cause 
obviously it's not just koalas 
a lot of other animals are either killed or injured too in the fires 
okay, this is another place on my list of places to visit 
there is a bus that goes there every morning at 9:00 a.m. 
would you like me to book a place for you 
yes, I'll go tomorrow 
will the bus pick me up from the hotel

right around the corner is the weekend market 
it is open right now 
you could start there 
oh yes, thank you. I will 
and after 
across from the boat quay 
is the Opera House 
you could take a tour of the complex 
that sounds good, too 
what shows they're on at the moment 
well, here is a leaflet containing all the performances this month 
you can check for availability of seats at the booking office while you're there
