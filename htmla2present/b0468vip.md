a website for the company oh yes those
are coming along well sorry I think I
need some new technology well what do
you need a new scanner what's that it's
a scanner sir but it's not nearly as
good as this one
this one would give us much better
photos okay and a digital camera would
be good what's that it's not a digital
cameras earth it won't take pictures as
easily as this one okay and also a new
laptop
it's not as fast as this one I see
anything else a new DVD drive and I
could also use a new joystick a joystick
isn't that for computer games well I
don't really need the choice on what's
all this gonna cost me
well actually we could do without the
DVD Drive and the laptop and the camera
and the scanner great

will say decide and decision actually
this is the site for the verb decide
that means after thinking carefully
about something you finally make make a
decision or that means you choose
something that you think is good up

site beside in this one the now is
decision okay
