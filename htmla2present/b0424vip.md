mm-hm dear forehand pardon   
oh sorry we private investigators are naturally curious Bunch MS Li perhaps   
you'd better tell the whole story   
it all started two years ago    
my mother David worked in the family business too   
but he didn't like it he wanted to try   
something different so what happened my   
parents agreed they let him come to Australia to study    
where did he go    
he came here to Adelaide    
he studied computer science    
we thought he was happy and then what happened    
I don't know he wrote every week    
and then the letters stopped    
do you know where he lived    
he stayed with an Australian family    
he was a boarder and here's the address   
did you find them    
yes of course    
he left there a year ago    
I don't know where he went   
does he have a mobile phone    
I don't know   
he did but he doesn't answer it now   
[Music]   
don't worry miss Li I'll find your brother   
hmmm it's very smooth    
good flavor to it   
sells well in restaurants here I think   
these are so well in Singapore the samples you sent me were very popular with our staff    
huh you seem to understand our taste of Singapore    
thank you it's my job to know what my clients like so are you enjoying the city well   
that's very nice    
what are you going to do tomorrow    
I don't know    
I'll probably stay in the hotel and relax    
why don't you come to lunch with us at home    
oh thank you but you have your family    
yes and they want to meet you    
we're going to have roast chicken traditional Aussie food

it's a beautiful home Sarah so big the rooms are much bigger than at home   
there's more space here do you live in a house no Steve    
she lives in an igloo   
actually no we live in an apartment most people do Singapore is much busier than Adelaide and more crowded yeah and more   
exciting so boring    
here it's quieter some people like that    
I don't think it's boring Adelaide is a very beautiful city   
it's a better place to live than anywhere else    
I've been but you haven't been anywhere mark hates traveling   
I love it I just don't see the point of it    
what about you Steve   
do you like struggle

[Applause]   
I'm sorry about my brother you have a lovely family everyone seems so happy   
mmm what's the matter there's something

I came to Australia to find him   
I'm so sorry   
have you had me luck

do you think you'll find him perhaps    
I don't know it's been a long time since David last called    
what do you think's happened to him    
have you any idea    
I really don't know   
I can't help thinking of Wurst    
I'm sure   
he's alright if something bad had happened you would have heard I guess so   
I suppose you're right    
can I hope you find your father    
oh you're very kind   
it's not your problem    
I want to help   
what can I do

nice smile    
she told her little

does he play a lot of sport   
well he used to what does he do

he sounds nice    
I'm looking forward to meeting him come in and good morning

hello

Steve Parker

Oh Steve hello Steve   
hi what are you doing   
Oh working I'm planning a trip to the wineries later in the week   
Oh what are you going Wednesday good   
what are you doing tomorrow   
nothing why I was just wondering   
well I was just wondering whether you want to go to a wildlife park with me   
you'd like to go to the zoo    
that's right ideas    
yes thank you Steve    
I'd love to go all right    
I'll meet you in the foyer 10 o'clock    
okay 10 I'll see you then great look you're not in   
I'm sorry to hear your brother's gone   
missing this way    
we're all so worried   
I've come to a delay to look for him how long did he study here   
I'm not sure two semesters did he get good grades    
I'm afraid not   
I don't think computer science was the right direction for him the investigator   
mr. Barbour said you have a letter from David    
of course it's it's addressed to you    
I told him I'd only give it to you in person   
dear Anne please don't look for me I   
need to be by myself    
I can't study anymore    
tell mom and dad to forget about me and take care of themselves   
you too look after yourself I'm sorry   
love your brother David here    
I don't know what to do I think you should go to the police    
but he says I shouldn't look for him    
yes well he might have felt that way then but a years a long time    
if I were you I'd report your brother missing   
should I tell my parents about the letter    
your poor parents    
they must be so worried    
I think you should tell them   
what you know what if I can't find him   
have faith I'm sure you will you know   
your brother you'll find him   
I'll show you out well good luck Leslie   
I don't know what else to do   
why don't you advertise in a newspaper put a photograph of your brother    
there somebody might recognize him    
it's good I hadn't thought of that my advice is never give up   
thank you for your help   
when you find your brother say hello to him for me    
I will these are our whites   
why don't you try the Chardonnay first   
it's our best-selling wine   
lovely mmm good fruit perhaps a little immature    
yes it's made from some of our youngest vines it is our most popular white at the moment try this Riesling   
hmm very al isn't it a lot of our customers are finding it very attractive   
it's a bit too dry for our market    
I think we'll leave that one    
but I like the Chardonnay    
I think we can sell that excellent    
let's try the roads our Reds are as good as any you'll find around here    
what have we got here this is our Cabernet Sauvignon   
it's very popular a bit too much fruit at this stage    
I understand it wasn't a good year for Cabernet in this district   
you know your wines misleading    
I try to be prepared    
what's your best read this one our Shiraz and we think it's   
world-class   
it's lovely color deepest red vintage is this it's three years old now it'll drink well for years yet    
but you can drink it right now - and what's the price    
well it's our most expensive wine at $50 retail    
and I'll think about it   
it certainly got potential    
but there are a lot of wines around in this class   
these days we've got a lot of competition Tim    
that's for sure   
but we can work out a special price for you    
if you're interested    
I'm definitely interested this is very good Sarah knows our requirements in pricing position    
I'm sure you can work out something with her   
I'm sure we can   
[Music]

I have some phones   
please brush first record poison plays

okay how about here   
so what are you doing in the market    
I'm cooking that you'll have some fried    
I remember coolest product that'll be great   
what about you deke on your money    
when someone says do you come here often   
it's what we call up pick-up line    
you know it's so inspiring    
I would have picked up lighting    
sorry I come here if he waits by foot   
I like fresh fruit for what you're having for dinner    
you'll find out on Friday chop chicken   
yep and a tea please Jimmy take you shopping home    
what to put in the fridge   
boys no that's okay    
I have a fridge in my room at the hotel   
the person who saw Peter to think it was   
that's a long story   
maybe I'll tell you later   
Rawdon maybe I thought    
I saw David at the market but    
I didn't get a very good look    
and I lost him in the crowd    
when was this just yesterday    
how long since you've seen him    
nearly two years     
are you sure    
you'd recognize him now    
of course he's my brother    
it's just I'm thinking he might have changed his appearance if he didn't want to be found   
mr Barber I would recognize my brother   
believe me of course    
I'm sorry maybe you did see him at the market    
it's just you've been thinking about him a lot the mind plays tricks you know suppose like maybe it wasn't him    
I don't know is there anything that would positively identify him    
a jury ask are anything his watch my father gave it to him    
he always wears it can you describe it    
it's an old fashioned watch and Omega   
it was our grandfather's    
what's the band made of silver and the watch has an   
inscription it says to my son Norman   
that's our father's name    
grandfather gave it to him Norman in Chinese    
in Chinese he might have a neck band    
I gave it to him as a going-away present    
what did like it's made of tortoiseshell   
it's a disc with a design like this    
oh yeah   
that's right you know it it's a band   
it's made of leather he said    
he'd always wear it yes well    
it's so it's it's just so much    
but it's something I suppose   
I'll call you next week with some news
