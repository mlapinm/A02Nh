unit 16    
shopping   
hi. can I help you    
yes. I'd like to buy a washing machine    
okay   
which brand would you like    
I don't care so much about brand    
so, what are you looking for    
I'm looking for good price and good functions    
okay   
function and price are important to you   
that's right   
okay. first may I ask you    
what size washer do you need    
what do you mean by what size washer    
well like a small size is four kilos    
large size is 8 kilos    
do you have a medium size    
sure. medium size is six kilos    
okay. I think. I want a medium size    
all right and do you want a one bin or a two bin washer    
what's the difference between one bin and two bin   
well with a two bin washer you have to move the clothes to the spinner yourself   
and the one-bin    
it does it automatically    
it's a two-in-one spin bin    
I understand   
which one cleans better    
they clean the same    
really    
and do the washers cost the same    
well. the one bin washer is more expensive    
but it's simple to use    
simple is important    
well. I think. I'd like the one bin washer    
you know if you like things simple and easy    
may I suggest to you the fuzzy logic function    
what is the fuzzy logic    
fuzzy logic is a special function   
it makes using the washer easier    
how does the function work    
well. you put in your clothes    
you put in the soap and the washer does the rest    
sounds perfect    
this is exactly the kind of washing machine
