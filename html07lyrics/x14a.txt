## I will survive
[I will survive - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G04NHM0w7ZM&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, hey, hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh-so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high and you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
Well, now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's loving me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive

Oh
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
Do you think I'd crumble
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive
I will survive

## I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing
[Aerosmith - I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing Lyrics - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ss0kFNUP4P4&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
Watch you smile while you are sleeping
While you're far away and dreaming
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
I could stay lost in this moment forever
Cause every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Lying close to you feeling your heart beating
And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
Then I kiss your eyes
And thank God we're together
I just want to stay with you in this moment forever
Forever and ever

Don't wannna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I don't wanna miss one smile
I don't wanna miss one kiss
I just wanna be with you
Right here with you, just like this
I just want to hold you close
Feel your heart so close to mine
And just stay here in this moment
For the rest of time Yeah yeah yeah

I don't wanna close my eyes 
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you
The sweetest dream will never do
I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

I Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
Cause I'd miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing
Cause even when I dream of you

I'd still miss you babe
And I don't wanna miss a thing

Don't wanna close my eyes
I don't wanna fall asleep
And I don't wanna miss a thing

## Still Falling For You
[Ellie Goulding - Still Falling For You (Official Video) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvP_OwVSFpk&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Fire and ice
This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for ...

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I’m in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
I’m still falling ...
And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I’m still falling for you


## Time After Time
[Time After Time (Acoustic Cover) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYgfAq6ttYc&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

TIME AFTER TIME
Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after...

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

You said, "Go slow", I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time

Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after
Time after


## Every Breath You Take
[Every Breath You Take - Music Travel Love (The Police Cover) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_zDUTFJfcY&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you
Oh can't you see
You belong to me
My poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please
Oh can't you see
You belong to me
My poor heart aches
With every step you take
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you
I'll be watching you 
(Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say, every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break, every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say, every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say, every game you play, every night you stay)
I'll be watching you



## Last Christmas
[“Last Christmas” - Wham!/Taylor Swift (Rock Cover by First To Eleven) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvAbKoKYTfE&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, You gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well it's been a year,
It doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas!)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying
«I love you» I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

(Oooh… Oooh Baby)

A crowded room,
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My God!
I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
But a face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oooh Oooh
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, You gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas,
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, You gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover
With a fire in his heart
(Gave you my heart)
A man undercover
But you tore me apart
I'll give it to someone,
I'll give it to someone special.

[Heaven - Bryan Adams (Boyce Avenue feat. Megan Nicole acoustic cover) on Spotify & Apple - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0wW9RwpG7M&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Now nothin' can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now
You keep me comin' back for more

And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

Oh - once in your life you find someone
Who will turn your world around
Bring you up when you're feelin' down

Yeah - nothin' could change what you mean to me
Oh there's lots that I could say
But just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven

I've been waitin' for so long
For somethin' to arrive
For love to come along

Now our dreams are comin' true
Through the good times and the bad
Yeah - I'll be standin' there by you

And baby, you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe
We're in heaven

And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven, heaven, oooh

You're all that I want
You're all that I need

We're in heaven
We're in heaven
We're in heaven

Chorus1:
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle,
In them old cotton fields back home;

Chorus2:
It was down in Louisiana,
Just about a mile from Texarkana,
In them old cotton fields back home.

Chorus3:
Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton,
In them old cotton fields back home.

Got on board a westbound seven forty-seven
Didn't think before deciding what to do
Oh, that talk of opportunities, TV breaks and movies
Rang true, sure rang true

Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California, but girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours

Out of work, I'm out of my head
Out of self respect, I'm out of bread
I'm underloved, I'm underfed, I want to go home
It never rains in California, but girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours

Will you tell the folks back home I nearly made it?
Had offers but didn't know which one to take
Please don't tell 'em how you found me
Don't tell 'em how you found me
Gimme a break, give me a break

Seems it never rains in southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California, but girl, don't they warn ya?
It pours, man, it pours...

Juanita came to me last night and she cried over and over
Ooh, Daddy I love you you know and I think it's the moonlight
She looked so fine, well she looked alright and she moaned
Ooh, Daddy move over

Oh, baby you know what I like and I think it's the moonlight
Made in Mexico, schooled in France ooh la lovin'
She needed no teachin'
Oh man, I can say international ways, I believe in

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I gotta heart as big as a stone and I need you, believe me
To be here and love me tonight
Mexican girl, I want you to stay, you know my heart is
Longing to say that as long as I live I will always
Remember the one that I called my Mexican girl



## It's only Christmas
[It's only Christmas - Ronan Keating & Hayley Westenra HD - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDEZc9zi7Cg&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

An only child alone and wild, a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

My brother's lives were different for they heard another call
One went to Chicago and the other to St Paul
And I'm in Colorado when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose and come to know so well

I thank you for the music and your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
I thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
And papa, I don't think I said I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
I am a living legacy to the leader of the band

[This Song Will Inspire You To Let Go (TAKE CHANCES EVERY DAY) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5uzxE8d0mY&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

"Lately I’ve been going nowhere
Keep getting in my own way,
nobody but myself to blame
Perfection never is the answer

I’m never gonna make it far,
if fear’s my only Northern star
So I’m trying,
to not be afraid
Yeah, I’m learning
to trust myself anyways

I’ve lost too much time and joy,
that can never be replaced
So I’m choosing
to take chances everyday

Every new day brings opportunity
to be better than I was before
and love myself a little more
Don’t need to have all the answers
to be ready to make a change,
no I don’t want to live this way

So I’m trying
to not be afraid
Yeah, I’m learning
to trust myself anyways"

## Dont let me fall
[Dont let me fall - Lenka - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBbU_wzWCgg&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Underneath the moon, underneath the stars
Here's a little heart for you
Up above the world, up above it all
Here's a hand to hold on to

But if I should break, if I should fall away
What am I to do?
I need someone to take, a little of the weight
Or ill fall through

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

Take a little time, walk a little line
Got the balance right
Give a little love, gimme just enough
So that I can hang on tight

We will be alright, I'll be by your side
I wont let you down
But I gotta know, no matter how things go
That you will be around

You're just the one that I've been waiting for
I'll give you all that I have to give and more
But don't let me fall

Don't let…

[Calum Scott, Leona Lewis - You Are The Reason (Duet Version) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByfFurjQDb0&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

There goes my heart beating 
Cause you are the reason 
I'm losing my sleep 
Please come back now 

There goes my mind racing 
And you are the reason 
That I'm still breathing 
I'm hopeless now 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason 

There goes my hands shaking 
Cause you are the reason 
My heart keeps bleeding 
And I need you now 

If I could turn back the clock 
I'd make sure the light defeated the dark 
I'd spend every hour, of every day 
Keeping you safe 

I'd climb every mountain 
And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason 
You are the reason 
Yeah, yeah...

And swim every ocean 
Just to be with you 
And fix what I've broken 
Oh, ‘cause I need you to see 
That you are the reason

Oh, I love your precious heart
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart, oh
And we could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
Oh, I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart, oh
And they could never ever tear us apart
Oh, oh, oh
I was standing 
You were there 
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart 
Tear us apart, ooh woah
And they could never ever tear us apart

You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down), mmm
There's only one way down

I'm giving you up

If you're ready, if you're ready (send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready (send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

## You Belong With Me
[OFF LIVE - Taylor Swift "You Belong With Me" Live On The Seine, Paris - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWD9ANVAfMg&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

## Skyfall
[Adele - Skyfall (Lyric Video) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeumyOzKqgI&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know…

## You're Gonna Be Okay
[You're Gonna Be Okay (Lyric Video) - Brian & Jenn Johnson | After All These Years - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjF9IqvXDjY&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

[Verse 1]
I know it's all you've got to just be strong
And it's a fight just to keep it together, together
I know you think that you are too far gone
But hope is never lost, hope is never lost

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, don't let go

[Chorus]
Just take one step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
You're gonna be ok

[Verse 2]
I know your heart is heavy from those nights
But just remember that you are a fighter, a fighter
You never know just what tomorrow holds
And you're stronger than you know, stronger than you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, don't let go
                God bless you!

## Wrecking Ball
[Miley Cyrus - Wrecking Ball (Director's Cut) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YICuUtkjlg&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore 
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door 

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door 
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

## Top of the World
[Carpenters - Top of the World & We've Only Just Begun - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyFB6SA7b4&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Such a feelin's comin' over me
There is wonder in 'most every thing I see
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
And I won't be surprised if it's a dream
Everything I want the world to be
Is now comin' true especially for me
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
Somethin' in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

[Leaving, On a Jet Plane ("Greatest Hits" Version) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9sf7C7D3nk&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go
I'm standin' here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breakin'
It's early morn
The taxi's waitin'
He's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome
I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time
Let me kiss you
Then close your eyes
And I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times, I won't have to say
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go
But, I'm leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

## Big Big World
[Emilia- Big Big World Lyrics - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDupadpaWI&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
Miss you much...

I can see the first leaf falling
It's all yellow and nice
It's so very cold outside
Like the way I'm feeling inside

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
Miss you much...

Outside it's now raining
And tears are falling from my eyes
Why did it have to happen?
Why did it all have to end?

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
Miss you much...
I have your arms around me warm like fire
But when I open my eyes
You're gone...

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
Miss you much...

I'm a big big girl
In a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
But I do feel I will miss you much...
Miss you much...

[Guns N' Roses - Patience - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErvgV4P6Fzc&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

One, two, one, two, three, four
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure
But you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

Said "woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine"
All we need is just a little patience
Said "sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine"
All we need is just a little patience (Patience)
Mm, yeah

I sit here on the stairs
'Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider

Said "woman take it slow and things will be just fine"
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said "sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright"
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it, I'll never break it
'Cause I can't take it

Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
Need a little patience, yeah
Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night)
Just trying to get it right (A little patience, yeah)
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (Gotta have more patience, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah but I need you (All need more patience)
Oh, I need you (All need some patience)
Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)
Ooh this time (Is all you need)


## What's Up
[4 Non Blondes - What's Up (Official Video) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NXnxTNIWkc&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution

And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution

And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
And I, I am feeling a little peculiar

And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
"What's going on?"

And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
Hey-ey-ey
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey-ey
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"
And I say, hey-ey-ey
(Wake in the morning and step outside)
Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah
(Take a deep breath and I get real high)
(And I scream)
I said "Hey, a-what's going on?"

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, uh huh

25 years and my life is still
Tryin' to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination, mmm


## Shallow
[Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (from A Star Is Born) (Official Music Video) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo_efYhYU2A&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longin' for change
And in the bad times I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for a change
And in the bad times I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We're far from the shallow now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoah

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We're far from the shallow now
