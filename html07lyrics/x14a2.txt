## HALO
[HALO - Beyoncé (2 Cellos & Piano) - Brooklyn Duo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPEmEMp8zp4&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   


I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were
Yeah, yeah
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missin' you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missin', too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay
I miss you

## Rolling in the Deep
[Rolling in the Deep ~ ADELE~ Lyrics - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJ_1y3iNvwc&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

we could've had it all
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
It all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat

It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'em

You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You've saved my life again

There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I'm hypnotized by your destiny
You're magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts, I can see your dreams

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
Touch every place in my heart
And it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do, oh
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

You say I am loved
When I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong
When I think I am weak
You say I am held
When I am falling short
When I don’t belong
You say I am Yours
And I believe
I believe
What You say of me
I believe

The only  thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity

You say I am loved
When I can’t feel a thing

You say I am held
When I am falling short
When I don’t belong

Taking all I have and now I’m laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God, and You’ll have every victory

You say I am loved
When I can’t feel a thing

I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces, of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really sayin', "I love you"

I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Yes, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh yeah!

## Have You Ever Seen The Rain
[Have You Ever Seen The Rain ? - Creedence Clearwater Revival (lyrics)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmTiK9jp970) 

Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, 
it's been coming for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, 
shining down like water

*I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain ? 
I want to know
Have you ever seen the rain
Coming down on a sunny day? *

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, 
been that way for all my time
Till forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know, it can't stop, 
but I wonder (*)

Danny Boy Londonderry Air Words for Irish songs music.
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!
But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!




## Cranberries Linger
[The Cranberries - Linger (Official Music Video) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Kspj3OO0s&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   


If you
If you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything

I swore
I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ah ah
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong
I was wrong

If you
If you could get by trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ah ah
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ah ah
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ah ah
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

[Dido - White Flag (Official Music Video) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-fWDrZSiZs&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or tell you that.
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
Where's the sense in that?

I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or return to where we were

But I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come back again
And I caused nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't talk to me again

And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

And when we meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on....

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

[Backstreet Boys - As Long As You Love Me (Clive's Cut) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gl2QnHNpkA&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance

And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes

What you did and where you're coming from
(I don't care)
As long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me

Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so, I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I've found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you

I don't know
But I think I may be fallin' for you
Dropping so quickly
Maybe I should keep this to myself
Waiting 'til I know you better
I am trying, not to tell you
But I want to,
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
As I'm standing here
And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance
All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me
I am trying not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
Oh, I just can't take it
My heart is racing
The emotions keep spilling out
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking about ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found ya
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking about it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I can't stop thinking about it
I want you all around me
And now I just can't hide it
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you
Oh
Oh no no
Oh
Oh, I'm fallin' for ya

Party girls don’t get hurt
Can’t feel anything, when will I learn?
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one for a good time call
Phone’s blowing up, ringing my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw ‘em back till I lose count
I’m gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I’m gonna live like tomorrow doesn’t exist
Like it doesn’t exist
I’m gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I’m gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
But I’m holding on for dear life
Won’t look down, won’t open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
Help me, I’m holding on for dear life
Won’t look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
Sun is up, I’m a mess
Gotta get out now
Gotta run from this
Here comes the shame
Here comes the shame
(Aaah)
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
One, two, three, one, two, three, drink
Throw ‘em back till I lose count
I’m gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
I’m gonna live like tomorrow doesn’t exist
Like it doesn’t exist
I’m gonna fly like a bird through the night
Feel my tears as they dry
I’m gonna swing from the chandelier
From the chandelier
But I’m holding on for dear life
Won’t look down, won’t open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
Help me, I’m holding on for dear life
Won’t look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
Oh, I’m just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
‘Cause I’m just holding on for tonight
Oh, I’m just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

Now, let the day
Just slip away
So the dark night may watch over you
Velvet, blue
Silent, true
It embraces your heart and your soul
Nocturne

Never cry - never sigh
You don't have to wonder why
Always be - always see
Come and dream the night with me
Nocturne

Have no fear
When the night draws near
And fills you with dreams and desire
Like a child asleep
So warm, so deep
You will find me there waiting for you
Nocturne

We will fly - claim the sky
We don't have to wonder why
Always see - always be
Come and dream the night with me
Nocturne

Though darkness lay
It will give way
When the dark night delivers the day
Nocturne

I've always been the kind of girl
That hid my face
So afraid to tell the world
What I've got to say
But I have this dream
Bright inside of me
I'm gonna let it show
It's time to let you know
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now 
Gonna let the light shine on me
And now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me, yeah
Yeah
Do you know what it's like
To feel so in the dark
To dream about a life
Where you're the shining star
Even though it seems
Like it's too far away
I have to believe in myself
It's the only way
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now 
Gonna let the light shine on me
Now I've found who I am
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be
This is me, yeah
You're the voice I hear inside my head
The reason that I'm singin'
I need to find you
I gotta find you
You're the missing piece I need
The song inside of me
I need to find you
I gotta find you
This is real, this is me
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now 
Gonna let the light shine on me, yeah
There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be

There's no way to hold it in
No more hiding who I want to be

[This Song Will Remind You To Love WHO YOU ARE (Meant For You) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYKRp01qwj0&list=RDw-JUNYwstpo&index=27)   

Life is what you make of it
It’s the fire in your soul
If you keep on hiding it from the world
You will never know
Who will see the best in you
And stand by you through the storms
So keep shining bright like the sun
And don’t stop for anyone

Some will stay, some will go
Always remember
They don’t define who you are
Let them stay, let them go
Never forget
You gotta love who you are
And those who love the real you
Are meant for you

You were born to stand out
So what are you waiting for?
When you realize you are one of a kind
No one can dim your light

Some will stay, some will go
Always remember
They don’t define who you are
Let them stay, let them go
Never forget
You gotta love who you are
And those who love the real you
Are meant for you

When you know your truth
You know what you deserve
You know what is best for you
So don’t be afraid to have it all

It’s time to be the real you
And find out who you are
Take your own path and see who walks with you
The right ones will want to

Some will stay, some will go
Always remember
They don’t define who you are
Let them stay, let them go
Never forget
You gotta love who you are
And those who love the real you
Are meant for you
